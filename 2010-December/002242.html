<PRE>Eduardo,

&gt;<i>  KIWI looks a lot like the code in NLPOS 9. I am using it in SLEPOS11.
</I>
I was involved into NLPOS9 and scr, so you are right at least some
parts of the netboot code are derived work from that old days :)

&gt;<i> in NLPOS9 non / partitions were preserved. in SLEPOS11 they seem to
</I>&gt;<i> always get reformatted. Is this the expected behaviour? Is there
</I>&gt;<i> something I can do to restore NLPOS9's way?
</I>
NLPOS9 and also SLEPOS11 had the request that the created partitions
are at fixed locations (swap always the first followed by root...).
In v9 we used fdisk which allows to specify the partition id. With
v11 we switched to parted which doesn't allow that and therefore the
ptable is wiped before the new partitions are created. You can give
it a try if you remove the line:

   dd if=/dev/zero of=$DISK bs=512 ...

from the netboot/suse-linuxrc code. But after that you can't be
sure about the partition ids of your newly created partitions
which more or less requires an entire rewrite of the config.&lt;MAC&gt;
evaluation... which might be a good idea anyway ;)

the old way of overwriting existing ptable entries was also
not really failsafe and could create gaps in the geometry and
did not make sure that the filesystem inside the existing
partitions stays valid

Basically I would vote for rewriting this part and make the
wipe of the ptable an option and remove the requirement to have
the root swap and other partitions at a specific id. but
for released products this is unfortunately not possible

Regards,
Marcus
