<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I have been using multiple profiles and have been using --add-profile
</I>&gt;<i> to do so.  (or just using import=&quot;true&quot; on several profiles)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I notice that when using --add-profile the bootinclude option for a
</I>&gt;<i> package/archive in the packages section doesn't seem to work. 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this by design?
</I>
no that's not by design. You should see messages like

    using profile(s) ...

in the kiwi log file. This tells you which profiles kiwi is using
Maybe one pitfall to mention is the profiles in the import=&quot;true&quot;
are only imported if you don't have --add-profile set on the
commandline. In other words if you want them to be still imported
you need to add them with a --add-import too
 
if you see all your profiles to be used and according to this
a bootinclude should be handled but isn't this is a bug then
which needs a fix

&gt;<i> Currently I've backed off to using the 4.65 release as I can do most of what I want with this version, but I notice that in 4.68 only one profile can have import=&quot;true&quot; so the way I'm getting things to work won't work in the future.
</I>
yes we found several problematic profile setups when we allow multiple
import=&quot;true&quot; attributes which was the reason why Robert added a check
to prevent this. I also stumbled over that problem and solved it
the following way. Given you have the following setup:

   &lt;profiles&gt;
      profile name=&quot;a&quot; description=&quot;a-info&quot; import=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
      profile name=&quot;b&quot; description=&quot;b-info&quot; import=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/profiles&gt;

   &lt;packages profiles=&quot;a&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;package name=&quot;x&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/packages&gt;

   &lt;packages profiles=&quot;b&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;package name=&quot;z&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/packages&gt;

you can change it to

   &lt;profiles&gt;
      profile name=&quot;ab&quot; description=&quot;a-info_b-info&quot; import=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/profiles&gt;

   &lt;packages profiles=&quot;ab&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;package name=&quot;x&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;package name=&quot;z&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/packages&gt;

&gt;<i> Is there a way we should be using multiple profiles so that this
</I>&gt;<i> won't occur?  Or should we be using multiple profiles at all?
</I>
I think multiple profiles makes sense if they are not added in
a way which requires them to be auto-included (import=&quot;true&quot;)
we use this for example to distinguish between a xen and non-xen
guest image. In that case it only makes sense to have one of
these profiles included

Regards,
Marcus
