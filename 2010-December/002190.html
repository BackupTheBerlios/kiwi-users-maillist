<PRE>Hi J,

&gt;<i> We run our own install script  in the boot image of our OEM build,  We 
</I>&gt;<i> need to run a binary executable that requires libstdc++.so.6 while running 
</I>&gt;<i> in the boot image. 
</I>
Uhm, *urgl* why do you want to that in the boot image ?

&gt;<i> (i.e. our of the DVD's initrd )  I attempted to 
</I>&gt;<i> request that the libstdc++43 package be included in the boot image with 
</I>&gt;<i> the following line in the config.xml:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;package name=&quot;libstdc++43&quot; bootinclude=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
</I>
Well the initrd is kept as small as possible therefore all not directly
linked libraries are ripped out. A small subset of dl loaded libraries
are excluded from that process though.

&gt;<i> The library was not included in the boot image initrd.  Is there an 
</I>&gt;<i> architected way to include extra simple software packages in the boot 
</I>&gt;<i> image initrd?  (The bootinclude=&quot;true&quot; for the megaraid_sas driver package 
</I>&gt;<i> worked great!)
</I>
bootincluding of drivers, configurations and friends was the intention
behind the feature. Installing additional software into the bootimage by
a bootinclude has always the same problem that the code which makes the
initrd small will rip out all the stuff which is not required to the
job this initrd code was made for.

Let me suggest another way:

1) install the software in your system image without bootinclude !

2) decide whether the code you want to run really needs to run
   inside the initrd or not:

   a) Assuming it doesn't have to run in the initrd
   =================================================

   - write a runlevel script which calls your software and place the
     script in etc/init.d/ in your root/ overlay files tree of the
     system image description
 
   - activate the service to run on boot by adding the following
     in your config.sh script of the system image description

     suseInsertService name

   b) Assuming it has to run in the initrd for whatever reason
   ============================================================

   - write a script called 'preCallInit.sh' which calls your software
   - place that script in a tarball so that it is listed with the
     following path and name

     /kiwi-hooks/preCallInit.sh

   - assuming the tarballs name is preCallInit.tgz then put that
     file in your system image description directory at the same
     level were your config.xml lives

   - add the following line in your system image config.xml:

     &lt;archive name=&quot;preCallInit.tgz&quot; bootinclude=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
 
     This will install the script in the initrd too and it
     will not be removed as it could happen with add-on libs
     The preCallInit hook runs inside the initrd exactly before
     calling the system init prozess. At that stage the root
     mount point has already moved into the system image which
     means you can access all software installed in the system
     image and that also includes your installer or whatever you
     would like to call

I hope that solves your problem. Any other place in the initrd
would require a code change imho and that also means you need to
maintain the code yourself ;)

Regards,
Marcus
