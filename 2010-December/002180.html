<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I know that there have been a &quot;world&quot; of changes in kiwi between 3.01 and 
</I>&gt;<i> 4.65 and am not surprised by some differences.  Is there a way to 
</I>&gt;<i> determine (i.e. a place to look for) which services Kiwi enables/disables 
</I>&gt;<i> on startup?  (Now that I look at config.sh, probably a pointer to: 
</I>&gt;<i> suseActivateDefaultServices)
</I>
I'm sorry that you had trouble with this and I must admit that the
default service setup has changed between 3.01 and 4.65. So you are right
if you have used only the suseActivateDefaultServices() function
it might happen that the result of active services is different
compared to the old version. The reason is that the old
suseActivateDefaultServices() was too 'clever' activating too many
services which was the reason why we change it to the default service
set used by a standard installation.

That said it's good to setup those services which you rely on by
an explicit insert call in your config.sh script. I have the following
in my scripts:

   #======================================
   # Functions...
   #--------------------------------------
   test -f /.kconfig &amp;&amp; . /.kconfig
   test -f /.profile &amp;&amp; . /.profile

   ...

   #======================================
   # Activate/remove services
   #--------------------------------------
   suseInsertService sshd
   suseInsertService boot.device-mapper
   suseRemoveService avahi-dnsconfd
   suseRemoveService avahi-daemon
   ...

That will also survive a kiwi update ;) The default services might
also be different according to the distro version so calling it
is ok but for services which have to be enabled I would put in
a suseInsertService ... call

Sorry for any inconvenience you had

Regards,
Marcus
