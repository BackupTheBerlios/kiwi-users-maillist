<PRE>Hi Marcus,

I had a question around post boot package installations, of which I
don't think there currently is any mechanism to do so, but I figured I'd
ask just in case I'm miss-understanding the documentation, or something
is not yet fully documented.

I work with a &quot;locked down&quot; image, most, if not all applications that
are installed on a particular image, are validated on a version by
version basis, then locked at that version until another review cycle
comes around. However, there is one in-house package that undergoes
enough changes during development that it simply extends the development
time by having to rebuild an entire image each time a new version is cut.

I'd like to be able to provide them with an image where the image itself
is locked down, but this package is &quot;transferred&quot; to the host during the
installation/booting stage, and installed. This could potentially save
many hours over the course of a week for these developers because they
wont need to keep rebuilding an updated image. They would simply stage
the new file into place, update the image's KIWI configuration file,
reboot the terminal and viola it'll download the new package.

Does something like this currently exist in KIWI?

</PRE>
