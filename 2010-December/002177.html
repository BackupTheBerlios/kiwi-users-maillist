<PRE>Marcus,

After updating my kiwi installation on openSuse 11.1 from the stock 3.01 
to 4.65 I have noticed that after booting the system image that is created 
with the kiwi --prepare step, there is a difference between what services 
are &quot;chkconfig'd&quot; on and off. (i.e. Which services start at boot time.) 
This has caused us some headaches in development with problems derived 
from  some important services not being started.

The only reason for updating to the newer version was to install a new 
kernel and associated drivers. (See the &quot;Adding drivers to the system 
image initrd &quot; thread in the November archives.) So the config files I use 
did not change very much.

I know that there have been a &quot;world&quot; of changes in kiwi between 3.01 and 
4.65 and am not surprised by some differences.  Is there a way to 
determine (i.e. a place to look for) which services Kiwi enables/disables 
on startup?  (Now that I look at config.sh, probably a pointer to: 
suseActivateDefaultServices)

Regards,

J.
