<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I made the image as ext3 file in place of clicfs.  The behavior was
</I>&gt;<i> totally different.
</I>&gt;<i> The image, with a tiny fat partition of about 150mb was about 3GB.
</I>&gt;<i> The initial boot was much slower.  I assume this is partly becuase the
</I>&gt;<i> image itself is much larger and needs to expand that to the USB drive
</I>&gt;<i> on first boot. The streaming issue is completely gone!  I was able to
</I>&gt;<i> run two streaming videos (in two Firefox tabbed windows) with out a
</I>&gt;<i> real issue.  The memory usage was about 228MB with the CPU swapping
</I>&gt;<i> between 38 to 75%.  It would go to 100% from time to time but it seem
</I>&gt;<i> to always recover.  The USB drive is being accessed much more now so
</I>&gt;<i> that tends to slow down applications starting and similar tasks.
</I>&gt;<i> Also I noticed now that the video caches where as before it didn't
</I>&gt;<i> seem to do this.   When I say 'caches&quot; I mean it's able to buffer
</I>&gt;<i> (preload) the video faster than it plays it which generally means that
</I>&gt;<i> it will play smoother.
</I>&gt;<i> Does this mean that clicfs has an issue with swapping?
</I>
Ok, so this really looks like a clicfs problem. I guess the
clicfs process crashed while you did the video streaming.
Hmm, that's bad. You can give it a try with a newer version
of clicfs (1.4) from here:

   <A HREF="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/filesystems/openSUSE_11.3/">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/filesystems/openSUSE_11.3/</A>

add that repo to your image config.xml and rebuild the image
with clicfs and ramonly enabled again. If the problem still
exist it could also be a bug in the kernel fuse layer.

Please also note that the kernel starts to kill userspace processes
if it runs of out resources. The clicfs process is a userspace
process and if the kernel kills it, it kills itself. That can't
be prevented by the nature of a fuse based filesystem.

Regards,
Marcus
