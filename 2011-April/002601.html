<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> My config.xml file has my oem swap space set to 4000.  I did this as
</I>&gt;<i> an extreme test to see if the behavior changes.
</I>&gt;<i> When I ran kiwi --create I set my fat storage to 3500mb..as I
</I>&gt;<i> understand that fat16 can have a max of 4000mb.
</I>&gt;<i> I booted from this image off the usb drive.  The boot time was a bit
</I>&gt;<i> slower.   I open a task manager to monitor RAM and CPU usage.
</I>&gt;<i> I then opened Firefox went to stream some video.  The video streaming
</I>&gt;<i> went very well for about 4 to 5 mins.  The RAM usage never made it
</I>&gt;<i> past 384mb (I'm assuming because I didn't set the &quot;RAM space&quot; as you
</I>&gt;<i> said?   The CPU usage after 4 to 5 minutes went to 100 percent and the
</I>&gt;<i> machine was useless. Nothing functioned.   Doing a ctrl+alt+backspace
</I>&gt;<i> took me out of the gui but didn't take me to the usual login/LXDM
</I>&gt;<i> screen.   It took me instead to a black screen with a flashing
</I>&gt;<i> cursor...and that was it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All of the above was test on the first boot of the image after kiwi
</I>&gt;<i> --create.   The second time I was opened Firefox and browsed Ebay and
</I>&gt;<i> some other basic sites and again the CPU maxed out and locked up the
</I>&gt;<i> machine...and the ram never made it past about 350mb.
</I>
Hmm, this sounds more like a clicfs problem. Can you do the
following:

  * boot the machine
  * open a terminal window and type

    su root
    tail -f /var/log/messages

  * leave the terminal alone but visible and start to do
    what you did before (browsing, streaming video, etc...)
   
  * watch the messages window for errors, do you see any
    filesystem related information ?

Thanks

&gt;<i> When you mentioned &quot;ram space&quot; are you referring to the &quot;oem swap
</I>&gt;<i> space&quot; in my config.xml file?
</I>
no, when I talked about RAM I meant the physical ram space
in your machine. From what you've said it looks like the
system doesn't swap at all. You said the CPU is at 100% and the
system is locked up. That's not normal for a system on swap.

&gt;<i> The primary purpose of this live image is to run an Internet browser
</I>&gt;<i> on a variety of sites. That would be it's primary function.
</I>
I got that. Would it be a problem for you to make another
test without the clicfs filesystem:

   &lt;type image=&quot;oem&quot; boottimeout=&quot;2&quot; filesystem=&quot;ext3&quot; boot=&quot;oemboot/suse-11.3&quot;&gt;  
Be aware after create the image will be much larger. But it's
for testing if we run into a clicfs problem here

Thanks

Regards,
Marcus
