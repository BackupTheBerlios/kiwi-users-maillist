<PRE>I've been doing the majority of my devel work on my live usb image as
root.  I'm am now ready to set all the permissions for a user.  I have
been unsuccessful to change the permissions on the mounted directory
to allow a user to write/read from it.  Even manually setting the
permission does not work.  Although there is no error when the command
is executed the permissions.

Marcus helped me with a script that looks for the fat partition an
mounts this partition.  This partition mounts to a folder in / file
tree.  Inside this folder is a bunch of system files and folder such
as &quot;boot&quot; and other config files.  Also in this folder is a storage
folder. It is this folder that I would like to change the permissions
for and everything inside this folder.  Robert gave me a few tips to
look at regarding mounting rules but nothing seem to worked.
