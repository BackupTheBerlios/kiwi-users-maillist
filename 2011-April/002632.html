<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Marcus does the auto location/mount of the fat partition script that
</I>&gt;<i> you gave me run on the very first boot?  I'm just trying to think of
</I>&gt;<i> any scripts that we/I added that may have the potintial to cause this
</I>&gt;<i> issue.  It has nothing to do with Firefox's user profile....I've saved
</I>&gt;<i> the entire /var/logs folder and will compare it to the second boot
</I>&gt;<i> versions.
</I>
The script I gave you can't have such an impact it just looks up
the root device and mounts the fat partition for you, nothing more
I you feel it might be related to this you can simply umount
the fat partition and see if it makes a difference but I'm sure
it will not

&gt;<i> Looking at Firefox more closely I noticed that on the second boot it
</I>&gt;<i> starts to cache/buffer the video as it plays.  The buffered video
</I>&gt;<i> preload ahead of the playing video like normal.  However after about 3
</I>&gt;<i> seconds of preloaded video is buffered or cached the indicator of this
</I>&gt;<i> buffered video actually goes backwards until it meets the same point
</I>&gt;<i> at the playing video indicator.  It's at this point that the video
</I>&gt;<i> stops and will not play again.
</I>
ok, so I think the system starts to swap at that point and
things go down then. It would be interesting to know about the
available memory in a first boot system and in a second boot
system. Just gather the information from 'cat /proc/meminfo' 
I also would like to see the information from 'cat /proc/mount'
from the first and the second boot. I also need the file
'/var/log/boot.kiwi' from first and second boot

&gt;<i> If this is a swap file or lack of
</I>&gt;<i> space problem why would it only happen on the second boot and not the
</I>&gt;<i> first
</I>
can't say that so far

&gt;<i> Since the minimum RAM needs to be 1gb I set the swap file at
</I>&gt;<i> 1500...although I think it should be double the ram amout at 2000mb.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any other settings that you can think of in the Kiwi config
</I>&gt;<i> file that might make a difference here?
</I>
nope

Regards,
Marcus
