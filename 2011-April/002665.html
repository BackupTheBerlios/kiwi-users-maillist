No,

Marcus, Chris has issues with the way the file system is mounted, i.e. 
user X cannot write to the mounted file system, irregardless of file 
ownership. Based on the description, I take it that the FAT partition 
gets mounted as read only for user and read/write for root. Therefore, I 
suggested that Chris take a look at the auto-mounting setup. 
Auto-mounting, to the best of my knowledge has two components. One 
component is formed by udev and the udev-rules. The other component is 
buried in the given desktop environment. I know that for both KDE and 
GNOME one can disable auto-mounting of devices or set rules how devices 
are mounted. I suspect something similar exists for LXDE, but I am not 
familiar with LXDE.

&gt;&gt;<i> if so fat doesn't have the user bits other filesystems have.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Marcus.
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't know that.  So this OS will have to be run as root in live
</I>&gt;<i> mode because the user will never be able to write to the storage
</I>&gt;<i> folders on the fat partition, correct?
</I>
No, think of the FAT partition as a stick in and of itself. If you go 
out and buy a new stick it is usually formatted with a FAT partition 
since every computer can read/write to this format. If you plug this new 
stick into your Linux box it will get mounted and the user for which the 
stick got auto-mounted will be able to rad/write to the stick. However, 
if you list the file that got copied to the stick you will see that the 
permission bits of the file itself are not what you would expect from a 
Linux file system. This is because a FAT filesystem has no notion of 
owner/group/other permission settings.

See <A HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rc/help/faq/permissions.html">http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rc/help/faq/permissions.html</A> for a 
refresher on Unix filesystem permissions, and 
<A HREF="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc783530%28WS.10%29.aspx">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc783530%28WS.10%29.aspx</A> for 
permissions info on a FAT based filesystem.

You are talking about the read/write permissions of the mounted file 
system while Marcus is pointing out that permissions on individual files 
on a FAT partition are different from the permissions on a Linux file 
system such as ext3, XFS, etc.

The two concepts, whether a user is allowed to read/write a mounted file 
system or not, and whether file system content reflects proper 
permissions are only loosely related. For purposes of discussion these 
concepts need to be clearly delineated to avoid confusion.

Anyway, in your case you have issues with the permissions of the mounted 
filesystem, not with the permissions of any given file on the filesystem.

HTH,
Robert
