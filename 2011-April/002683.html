&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I suspect the stick is auto-mounted and the permissions for the mount is set
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such that the user is allowed to write to the stick. You're FAT partition on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your image stick is mounted via script that is probably executed as root and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thus only root can write to the mounted filesystem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But you cannot issue 'mount' as a user unless you have an entry in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /etc/fstab that allows the user to mount the filesystem. Thus in your script
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that finds the FAT partition you could just modify /etc/fstab instead of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mounting the partition and then when the user gets logged in automatically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you run a script that mounts the FAT filesystem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks Robert.
</I>&gt;<i> I understand what's going on now thanks to your explanation.
</I>&gt;<i> So adding a line to my /etc/fstab like this &quot;/dev/sdb1     /SOS
</I>&gt;<i> vfat     rw,auto,user&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> what that do it?
</I>
Yes, this should do the trick. However, be aware that by the time you 
can add the line to fstab via script &quot;mount -a&quot; will already have been 
run, thus you will still need to mount the file system manually, at 
least the first time.

Note also that the &quot;user&quot; entry in /etc/fstab gives the user permission 
to mount this file system, it does not set the permissions of who is 
allowed to write to the file system. This should then depend on the 
permissions and ownership of the mount point, I think.

If you make the entry permanent you probably want to use 'noauto'

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would have to modify the script that I have now that finds and
</I>&gt;<i> mounts the this fat partition so that it doesn't auto mount the fat
</I>&gt;<i> partition.  Could I just change the fstab file to have this entry and
</I>&gt;<i> have the fat partition auto mounted using a script in maybe the
</I>&gt;<i> ~/.config/autostart or globally in the
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/init.rd/boot.local...
</I>
If you put the mount into boot.local the mount will be executed as the 
'root' user and depending on permission settings you might still end up 
a filesystem you cannot access as the root user.

&gt;<i> actually I think this mount script would
</I>&gt;<i> have to trigger the mounting of the fat partition after login right?
</I>
Yes, just let the &quot;automagic&quot; mount the filesystem. This is the best way 
for you to control that the user owns the mount.

HTH,
Robert
