<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I'm not confused. :)  I'm just stating that the &quot;ramonly&quot; element was
</I>&gt;<i> removed from the config.xml file and I have almost exactly the same
</I>&gt;<i> issues with streaming video.
</I>
Does the system swap ?

&gt;<i> When using a live image on CD it still uses the host system's ram so
</I>&gt;<i> what makes this so different than the same image on a CD?  The USB
</I>&gt;<i> transfer rates are higher than an optical drives..I'm pretty sure.  I
</I>&gt;<i> can live with the read/write image but this issues still exists.
</I>&gt;<i> I would imaging that the size of the USB drive would matter somewhat
</I>&gt;<i> because that is where the system swaps to once ram is full...no?
</I>
I don't understand what you are saying, sorry.

The USB stick image you created uses two techniques which
are different compared to a &quot;normal&quot; linux system:

 1) root overlay
 2) root compression

root is an overlay filesystem based on clicfs. Overlay
means the root filesystem is a compressed read-only
root tree which is mounted in a way that all write
actions are directed to either the RAM (ramonly) or
to a write space on the stick. If you choose the USB
stick as target to write you have more space left
on the RAM side. If you choose to write to RAM you
have less RAM space but writing is faster

It depends on the applications you are running if they
perform well on that system. If you think it doesn't
work well you can try the following:

a) remove ramonly and rebuild, you did that already
   you said there were no change in the performance
   I think that means there was no RAM space issue

b) change from clicfs to another filesystem type
   for example ext3. But that means you will loose
   root compression and will at least double size your
   image.
 
Hope that helps

Regards,
Marcus
