<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> On first boot about 3/4 of the way through it switches to verbose mode
</I>&gt;<i> and displays &quot;repartition the disk according to real geometry [parted]
</I>&gt;<i> Flag to Invert?&quot;  It's waiting for a response.  This didn't show up
</I>&gt;<i> when I had the swap file set to 1500 or 2000mb or when the fat
</I>&gt;<i> partition was set to 4gb.  I'm not sure what to do here but I ended up
</I>&gt;<i> typing &quot;boot&quot; and and it prompted me with &quot;New State? [on]/off&quot; I
</I>&gt;<i> choose &quot;off&quot;.  Last time I choose &quot;on&quot; and when I rebooted it
</I>&gt;<i> indicated that it could find the operating system.
</I>
Hmm, never had that problem. might be related to a parted
bug: <A HREF="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=453799">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=453799</A>

&gt;<i> Testing the Firefox profile I tried this:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Booted from a fresh OEM image from the flash drive
</I>&gt;<i> 2) went to YouTube and tested the streaming of a video.  As always on
</I>&gt;<i> the first, the video played fine.  It preloaded the entire video
</I>&gt;<i> within a minute and never paused or hiccuped at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 3) I copied the ~/.mozilla user profile to the 4GB fat partition on
</I>&gt;<i> the flash drive
</I>
ok

&gt;<i> 4) I rebooted the OS off the flash drive for the second time.
</I>&gt;<i> 5) I opened Firefox and navigated back to YouTube (same video as
</I>&gt;<i> before) it played for about 30-40 seconds and then stopped.   As
</I>&gt;<i> before I could see that the preloading/buffering of the video would
</I>&gt;<i> start but would only get about a quarter of the way and then it would
</I>&gt;<i> actually stop and go backwards towards the play indicator.  That's
</I>&gt;<i> when the video would stop.
</I>&gt;<i> 6) I close Firefox and navigate to the fat partition on the flash
</I>&gt;<i> drive where I saved the .mozilla profile folder from my first boot.
</I>&gt;<i> 7) I then copy that folder and attempt to overwrite the existing .mozilla in ~/.
</I>&gt;<i> 8) I get a bunch of errors with some of the files within that folder
</I>&gt;<i> that read &quot;Error splicing file: No space left on device&quot;
</I>
so you ran out of ram space if this is a ramonly=&quot;true&quot; image
strange because I don't understand why it happens after the first
boot only. The information from my former mail would help here

&gt;<i> Here is the partition table for the USB drive only.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> dev/sdb1               2.55GB          Linux native        FAT
</I>&gt;<i> dev/sdb2               5.02GB          Linux native
</I>&gt;<i> dev/KiwiVG             5.02GB          LVM2 KiwiVG
</I>&gt;<i> dev/KiwiVG/LVComp      560.00mb        LV
</I>&gt;<i> dev/KiwiVG/LVRoot      3.49GB          LV
</I>&gt;<i> dev/KiwiVG/LVSwap      1000.00mb       LV                  SWAP
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which of these paritions is taking up actual space on the drive?
</I>
sdb1 and sdb2. The partition table is ok

&gt;<i> FYI:  I'm having the kiwi.xml file create a users profile however all
</I>&gt;<i> of this testing is being done as the Root user in the image.  It
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't matter anyway I would think because the user's profile is
</I>&gt;<i> not on a separate partition.
</I>
correct. And I recommend to postpone this change until we know
why you ran out of space on second boot

&gt;<i> On the second boot I checked this partition table again and nothing
</I>&gt;<i> changed
</I>
That's ok and is intended

&gt;<i> I rebuilt the image again but this time did:
</I>&gt;<i> 2000mb as the swap
</I>&gt;<i> 4000mb as the Fat partition
</I>&gt;<i> total image size is 6020mb
</I>&gt;<i> Total drive space is still 7646mb
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The first boot went without any issues like before. I did NOT see the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;repartition the disk according to real geometry [parted]
</I>&gt;<i> Flag to Invert?&quot; It just autologin as it was suppose to.
</I>
This is because the re-partition step was skipped now because there
is not enough space left for a persistent read-write partition.
Even though you told the image to be ramonly kiwi prepares the stick
for persistent writing if one wants to switch off ramonly at a later
point in time. For that read-write part it needs some space. The
size can be set by the paramater oem-systemsize. In your case this
value plus your swap and fat setup exceeds the size of the USB stick
which results in the repart step to be skipped and as consequence
no swap partition will be created... normally not a big problem
except you ran out of space

&gt;<i> I checked the parition table shows
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> dev/sdb1                 3.91GB    linux native      FAT
</I>&gt;<i> dev/sdb2                 1.97GB    linux native
</I>&gt;<i> dev/kiwiVG               1.97GB    LVM2 KiwiVG
</I>&gt;<i> dev/kiwiVG/LVComp        560.00MB  LV
</I>&gt;<i> dev/kiwiVG/LVRoot        1.42GB    LV
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What happen to the Swap partition?
</I>
This is ok according to the new setup

&gt;<i> Despite that lack of a Swap partition the result are the same on the
</I>&gt;<i> first boot vs any boot after the first boot.
</I>
Ok, this means the system never is in the swap condition.
It looks like you simply ran out of space. But that should have
happened on first boot too. I'm really wondering. As you said
this is a ramonly image there is (beside the partition table change)
no persistent data written. So you should have the same root
filesystem size on first boot and after first boot (except your RAM
size has changed). What does

  df -h

tell you on the system where you have a swap partition

I recommend to not change the swap and fat parameters all the
time. Use one setup which does the repart on first boot and which
allows us to safely reproduce the problem. Maybe we will find
the cause of the problem then

Marcus
