<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; - system image completely in RAM
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - system image partially in RAM and local storage
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - system image completely on local storage
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - system image remotely mounted via NFS (network file system)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - system image remotely mounted via NBD (network block device)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In interest of having the quickest bootup time possible, I'm thinking that 
</I>&gt;<i> the NBD remote mounted system image is what I need.  Does that sound 
</I>&gt;<i> correct?
</I>
I guess yes :)

&gt;<i> &gt; I agree you don't need the terminal aspects here. So to make this work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you need the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) a system image tree exported via NFS or NBD
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) a PXE boot server based on the directory structure from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kiwi-pxeboot package
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) a netboot boot image and kernel built with kiwi
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) a config.&lt;MAC&gt; configuration file which includes one line
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; telling netboot to use NBD or NFS
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Would you mind to jump in and tell us according to the list
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; above at which point you are currently and what problems needs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be solved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you very much for the reply and explanations.  I'm really just 
</I>&gt;<i> getting started - but here is how I understand the process (and I'd 
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate it if you can correct me where I'm wrong)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, the kiwi-pxeboot package is installed, which provides the 
</I>&gt;<i> /srv/tftpboot structure necessary for the clients to boot.
</I>
correct

&gt;<i> Second, the kiwi-desc-netboot package is installed, which provides the 
</I>&gt;<i> config.xmls and scripts necessary to build the boot image (initrd).
</I>
correct

&gt;<i> This is the point where I need help.  If I do &quot;kiwi -c 
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/share/kiwi/image/netboot/suse-10.3 -r /tmp/pxe&quot;, what am I actually 
</I>&gt;<i> getting?  Just the initrd?
</I>&gt;<i> If so, what is the appropriate way to build the system? 
</I>
so first of all you don't need to build the boot image manually.
kiwi does that for you automatically. Your problem is you need a
system image description to start with. Let's have a look at the
example provided with the kiwi-doc package. It makes much sense
to have this one installed too. After that you will find an example
system image descriptions in /usr/share/doc/packages/kiwi/examples.
I suggest to take a look at the

	suse-pxe-client

example. If you open the file suse-pxe-client/config.xml you will
see the system image description. If you check the type line you will
see the following:

	&lt;type filesystem=&quot;squashfs&quot; boot=&quot;netboot/suse-10.3&quot;&gt;pxe&lt;/type&gt;

This means your system image is based on a compressed filesystem 
(squashfs) and the boot=... information tells kiwi to build the initrd
from the /usr/share/kiwi/image/netboot/suse-10.3 description.

For a first start I recommend to change &quot;squashfs&quot; into &quot;ext3&quot; to
avoid possible problems with the aufs overlay filesystem as you
intend to use NBD root.
 
&gt;<i> I'm thinking that I need to create a config directory structure (including 
</I>&gt;<i> config.xml for my image, and other scripts as needed).  But how do I tie 
</I>&gt;<i> the netboot initrd together with this system image?  I'm pretty sure it is 
</I>&gt;<i> done based on the &quot;&lt;type&gt;&quot; block in my images' config.xml, but some 
</I>&gt;<i> clarification would help here.
</I>
I think you almost got the picture :) I'm sure the information above
helps you to complete the gaps. Once you have your system image description
the kiwi --prepare call creates the new root of your image. A subsequent
call of kiwi --create will create all images including the boot images
in the specified destination directory. The boot image will be named
initrd-... I recommend to have a look into the pxe chapter of the kiwi.pdf
which is installed with the kiwi-doc package. You will find a step by step
guide how to setup the remote boot and more. 

For NBD root you need to make sure your new root tree is exported correctly
using the nbd-server application. You also should test if you can
successfully mount the root tree by nbd-client plus mount /dev/nbd0 ...
before you start your client to be sure the remote mount works in
principal

Good luck and do not hesitate do ask any question :)

Regards,
Marcus
