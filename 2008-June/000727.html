<PRE>&gt;<i> As my images change so seldom, I always do a kiwi -c. I know there are
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives, but  not using them has not been an issue. The main reason
</I>&gt;<i> I would rebuild would be trying some idea for getting the pxe boot image
</I>&gt;<i> to be much smaller. My current initrd is 18 MB.
</I>
My initrd, based on the ltsp boot image configuration is only 6.5MB.  If 
you're still looking for optimizations, you may find some there.

&gt;<i> I also use nbd. Have you experienced any problems with it? I also run a
</I>&gt;<i> diskless computer starting via pxe and getting / with nbd. However, if I
</I>&gt;<i> run on a fast private network with fast computers, nbd can very often
</I>&gt;<i> fail startup on the client. Changing the switch from a 1 GB to a 100 MB
</I>&gt;<i> solves the problem. Different brands of switches have been tried. This
</I>&gt;<i> is my outstanding issue with KIWI/NBD. Other than that it has worked
</I>&gt;<i> great.
</I>
I have read that in other places as well - I'm already using a 10/100 
switch, so I haven't seen too many issues. 

In my testing with two laptops - an IBM Thinkpad T60, and an old Compaq 
Evo N600 - my experience has been that NBD seems somewhat flakey.  It is 
interesting because with the newer machine (the thinkpad), I can use NBD 
with no issues.  But with the older laptop, I cannot get it to work. 
Testing with older desktops and NBD works fine. 

Because of this, I've switched to using NFS, which has been working with 
no problems whatsoever.  Since my plan may include a production 
deployment, I probably won't pursue NBD too much further.  Besides that, 
NFS performance is perfectly acceptable for my use.

Thanks,
Justin
