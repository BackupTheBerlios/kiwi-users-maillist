<PRE>Hi All,

v1.58 building. The most important change is the move of the
documentation. Some of you may know it already, we are writing
a book for openSUSE and kiwi will have one chapter of the book.
Therefore the current design document was moved into the book.
It's all work in progress so don't wonder if you see sections
with only a TODO in it :-)

The current kiwi package will have the kiwi.pdf which is now
a chapter of the book. I would like to ask all of you to take
a short look into the book and give feedback. Additionally I'm
open for any help here, even more I would like to invite everybody
to join the book-team. A good documentation becomes more and more
important and it's really hard work especially for non native
speakers. So thanks in advance

The following is a list of bugfixes and enhancements:

Enhancements:
=============
   - moved documentation to openSUSE book on forge.novell.com
     The book is work in progress as well as the kiwi chapter in
     there. I started to update the documentation and set the
     initial structure. There are some TODO entries which we are
     working on. Here is the book
    
       <A HREF="https://forgesvn1.novell.com/svn/opensuse/trunk/buildservice/documentation/">https://forgesvn1.novell.com/svn/opensuse/trunk/buildservice/documentation/</A>
   - added experimental support for network block device diskless
     boot, NBDROOT support (#304760)

   - added optional CD root data. The description can contain
     the file config-cdroot.tgz which is a gzip tar archive.
     The archive will be unpacked as CD root data and can contain
     license and/or README data (#299732)

Other Bugfixes:
===============
   - added nfs-client package to be part of netboot/suse-10.3
     fixed nfs mount for 10.3 mount.nfs was missing
   - added partition code by Jan &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/kiwi-users">jcbornschlegel at novell.com</A>&gt; and
     activate bootsplash for oemboot initrd
   - fixed splash files detection check in setupSplashForGrub()
   - removed squashfs-kmp-default from descriptions. The module ist part
     of the standard kernel of openSUSE 10.3 now

PS: Jan can you check where you usbstick tutorial may fit in the book
    Thanks a lot
   
Have Fun :-)

Regards,
Marcus
