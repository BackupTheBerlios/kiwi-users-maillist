<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Funny enough, if aufs goes away, what will kiwi do? It uses it for accessing 
</I>&gt;<i> the repos (for unknown reasons..). At least, it does strange things, if 
</I>&gt;<i> kiwi cannot load aufs (it leaves strange mount points lying around, which 
</I>&gt;<i> need to be mkdir'ed before they can be unmounted again.
</I>
kiwi doesn't rely on aufs. If it is installed I use it to establish
real read-only mounts of the repositories to be more safe if people
call rm -rf on the kiwi root tree :) Unfortunately a bind mount can't
be done using other options than the original base mount. If no aufs
is present kiwi uses bind mount to mount the repos inside the chroot
with the risk that if there is something wrong and people call rm -rf
on their kiwi root tree they might remove their repos too

&gt;<i> Okay, as a project maintainer, you have to say that.
</I>
:<i>-)
</I>
&gt;<i> But I'm happy, if I get 
</I>&gt;<i> to the point, where I was in 2005. Unfortunately it isn't all that easy. 
</I>&gt;<i> Looks like NFSROOT isn't exercised with UNIONFS_CONFIG setups for some time 
</I>&gt;<i> as problems in suse-linuxrc and friends indicate. I'm preparing a separate 
</I>&gt;<i> mail for that.
</I>
something like this should work:

   NFSROOT=192.168.100.7;/tmp/kiwi-11.1
   UNIONFS_CONFIG=/dev/ram1,nfs,aufs

but you don't want to write into RAM you want to write into another
NFS based location iirc. This is not implemented but I opened
#575658 for this one (Novell bugzilla)

&gt;<i> That sounds interesting, but again, I'm loosing performance, as I do access 
</I>&gt;<i> and modify the read-write parts. Is that at least possible with this 
</I>&gt;<i> approach? (IOW, is that cow file mountable, examinable and modifyable?)
</I>
If you want to modify the cow file you need to mount the clicfs
I agree it's not as easy as with an NFS based system

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It looks like current technologies in this area are not able to mimic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that fully out of the box. Aufs cannot use a nfs mount for its xino
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; file, and I do not want to give up on the two nfs mounts, either. But I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; might want to add nfs or nbd based swap (now, that's available). Looks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; like, that I need to use an tmpfs for the xino.
</I>
When kiwi mounts the aufs it creates a tmpfs for the xino. If #575658
is done you should at least be able to use the NFS based system.

Along with #575658 we could also add support for an alternative
write location for the NBDROOT system. You should be able to export your
NFS tree's then via nbd and could make use of the swap over nbd feature.
But you will still use aufs.

&gt;<i> Marcus, be prepared for a couple of patches soon..
</I>
whooo, sounds great :-)

Regards,
Marcus
