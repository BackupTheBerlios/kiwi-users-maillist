<PRE>[Jeff, I CC'ed you, since I guess, you're not in the audience of this list, 
but OTOH, KIWI setups suffer major pains because of the apparmor vs. aufs 
disharmony! You might want to read the &quot;[Kiwi-users] NFSROOT and 
UNIONFS_CONFIG touble&quot; thread]

Hi, 

after churning on this topic, I thought, it would be a good idea to let you 
know about the state of affairs.

My openSUSE 11.1 setup is working now, but it took quite some fiddling in 
the details to get it right (hostname, dhcp, sax, you name it..). The roll 
out happens this weekend. Kiwi was of immense help in this process, and it 
already had some fallout floating back into the project, successors might 
take advantage of.

The major issue to solve was that aufs vs. apparmor disharmony, and 
unfortunately, I'm not fluent enough with vfs to fix things up. My approach 
was creating my own kernel in build system, with aufs2 patches applied, and 
with apparmor (and novfs, as it depends on the API changes of AA) disabled. 

BS: home:frispete:aufs2

Jeff, if you're interested in adapting aufs2 on the openSUSE kernel, let me 
know. I can give you a bunch of hints and findings that might help you in 
this process.

Of course, NFS is mightily unloved, but it is exactly done for these kind of 
diskless setups. And the logical consequence of our doing is layering NFS 
filesystems. Therefore, although the openSUSE kernel and aufs don't like 
each other much, and aufs2 is not liked by some influential kernel coders 
as well, it's by far the superior approach to this problem domain (and some 
very interesting others: e.g. prepare build environments by layering the 
most often used package sets above each other could speed up build service 
by a few hundred procents, I guess..).

Marcus, what do you do, if you need to install an additional rpm, or change 
some global config? Rebuild the whole thing, and - depending on the network 
transport system - either turn off all users of the former image before 
switching? Add some switch logic, and wait a day? Tell a whole (small) 
company, that they should shutdown their desktops because one user/office 
needs another package is not going to cut it (in my environments, at 
least).

With my setup, I can do this on the fly. Yes, sometimes I suffer from some 
caching artifacts (in the range of 30 secs max..), and I won't do a full 
KDE* desktop update this way during the day, but that's not necessary 
either. I love this &quot;one source feeds all approach&quot;, but that also has to 
be dynamic, highly dynamic to be successfull in usual commercial settings.

See, where the alternatives of this technology are steering: opaque throw 
away containers, filesystem in files, only to simplify the transport, but 
this is a administration nightmare, and conceptually wrong.

I'm doing this diskless thing for two decades now, started with Ataris, 
where I've been responsible for the Biodata client code. Our strongest 
competitor (in the beginning) tried this block over (cheaper-)net 
approach - and guess what - they failed. Performance, stability and 
administration wise. They never got the locking right..

There might be setups, where these static container things might work, but 
those areas, where this diskless technology really rocks are dynamic. 

I'm responsible for the IT-setup of a transport company since 20 years as 
well, and the last aufs based NFS layered SuSE 9.3 setup was a big success, 
running for 5 years now without any hassles. The 40 full blown desktop 
systems (fat clients) just don't have harddisks, and a single VMware WinXP 
instance (that most users need, unfortunately) takes more administration 
efforts (and container space) than all SuSE systems combined. 

The new setup consists from 1230 rpm packages occupying 5,8 GB disk space.
The old one from 819 packages occupying the same 5,8 GB disk space. :-)
All hosts combined uses 879 MB persistent space (the RW layer, incl. /tmp).

Let's hope, that 11.1 works fine on the older systems, too. The box, where I 
finally failed to get the 9.3 going, is an 4GB AMD X4-955 24&quot; dual head 
system.

Pete
