<PRE>I got it to work.  I was missing a rpm folder that had a dependency.  Would have been nice if it told me that.  

I still don't know why kiwi was doing the public key lookup in the first place.  Like I said, all I did was install/remove smart several times.  I'm pretty sure all the keys were imported already but perhaps I missed one that got installed later.  Anyway, with rpm-check-signatures false I would think it should still work even if a public key is not installed.

Thanks,

Subject: RE: [Kiwi-users] How to stop rpm public key server access

Thank you for the responses.  Interesting update.  I have always had rpm-check-signatures set to false.  I'm using the suse-SLE10-JeOS template from kiwi-3.94-80.1, with only the &lt;repository&gt;'s modified (to local rpm-dir's).  

As you can see from my original email it was attempting to get public keys from a public key server.  However it is not doing that anymore.  I was installing/removing smart-1.2-5.1 and smart-0.41-23.4.x86_64.rpm.  I also remember trying some &quot;rpm --import&quot;'s and &quot;gpg --imports&quot; but I think all those commands said there was nothing new to import.

The kiwi log still has error's about the packages &quot;public key not available&quot;.  I doubled checked our corporate firewall is still blocking gpg key requests.  I also verified it's now not doing the key searches with both versions of smart.

But even if I didn't have all the public keys imported, shouldn't rpm-check-signatures prevent it from doing the key searches?  And why was it doing the key searches before and not now?

Kiwi is now giving me some package finding errors I guess that's another issue unless it's failing to use the packages from the specified repositories because of the &quot;public key not available&quot; error.  Can any of you tell me if this current build failure is because of the &quot;public key not available&quot; problem?  Attached is a kiwi build log with the errors.

Thanks,

Hi,

&gt;<i> I thought kiwi disabled rpm-check-signatures all the time&#223; Or there 
</I>&gt;<i> was an option to doing so in config.xml.
</I>
ok it works for me if

   &lt;rpm-check-signatures&gt;false&lt;/rpm-check-signatures&gt;

is set. Just building an image with smart

sorry for the noise Christoph

Regards,
Marcus
