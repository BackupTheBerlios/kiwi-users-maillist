<PRE>Hi Steve,

&gt;<i> We are trying to automate our image creation such that it can then
</I>&gt;<i> be dumped/flashed onto a partition ready to boot up and work.  We
</I>&gt;<i> want to avoid any manual image creation steps like deploying/installing
</I>&gt;<i> the image.
</I>
If you create the image type &quot;oem&quot; with kiwi the result would be a virtual
disk including all that. The bootloader, partition table, partitions,
filesystems and the data. This file can be dumped on the disk device.
On first boot of the machine the partition table and the filesystems
are enlarged to the real disk geometry and the system boots up. This
oemboot boot code also takes care for the fstab and also runs mkinitrd
as well as setup the bootloader and such. The downside of this image
type:

 * everything on the disk will be lost
 * you can only influence the partition setup to some degree
   (full freedom if you use LVM though)

I don't know exactly about your requirements in terms of the partition
table setup and if you need to take care for the data already on the
disk before deployment. But it's surely the easiest way of installing
an OS on a machine. The dump on the disk device can also happen from
for example Windows or over the network via PXE

&gt;<i> It would be great if kiwi had a option to create a single filesystem
</I>&gt;<i> image (a-la image=&quot;ext3&quot;) with a boot image that is ready for normal
</I>&gt;<i> boot (given you dump it someplace with the correct disk layout), and
</I>&gt;<i> with either supplying the fstab/grub files or options to specify the
</I>&gt;<i> swap and boot device.  Would this be a good RFC?
</I>
I think I don't understand why you want to separate all those steps ?
Is it because there is another system on the disk which you don't want
to loose ?

&gt;<i> I could do the following...  Use image=&quot;ext3&quot; and boot=&quot;oemboot*&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>  Mount or dump the filesystem image someplace.  Finish the image
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;install&quot; just like the oemboot does where LOCAL_BOOT=no
</I>&gt;<i> (minus the partitioning, etc).  End result being a image I can flash
</I>&gt;<i> and boot into.
</I>
This should work as long as the filesystem image can be found on
the first partition. The oemboot code expects that to be the case

&gt;<i> I've been going through the oemboot scripts to figure the install
</I>&gt;<i> parts out.  Is there anything other than fstab/grub config I need
</I>&gt;<i> to keep in mind that the kiwi --create has not done yet
</I>&gt;<i> (especially if I use image=&quot;ext3&quot;)?
</I>
That should be enough for booting. Keep in mind that your filesystem
image should be adapted to the real disk geometry so at least
a resize2fs might be required.

Regards,
Marcus
