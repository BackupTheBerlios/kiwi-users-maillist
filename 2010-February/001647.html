<PRE>As anyone reading this list knows, I have had a problem that I cannot
solve. Marcus has tried to help me, but the issue remains. I do not know
if it just that I am not explaining myself well, or if I am
kiwi-challenged. Probably a bit of both.

I will begin at the beginning, and try to be brief.

I am using KIWI 4.10-80.1 on openSUSE 11.2 to build images to be used by
diskless computers booting via PXE. My script files are based on those
in /usr/share/doc/packages/kiwi/examples/suse-11.2/suse-pxe-client

The repository is a locally mounted openSUSE 11.2 ISO. All is 32-bit. No
64-bit anywhere.

My config.xml file is basically the same as the pxe example (above). I
have added a few RPMs for things like lsof. The type specification is
unchanged:

&lt;type image=&quot;pxe&quot; filesystem=&quot;clicfs&quot; boot=&quot;netboot/suse-11.2&quot;/&gt;

My config.sh file is also basically the same, except that the services I
use are defined as:

suseActivateDefaultServices

suseInsertService sshd
suseInsertService portmap
suseInsertService nfs
suseInsertService xinetd

# Setup ssh host keys
rcsshd start
rcsshd stop

My images.sh file is also basically the same. I have added a few device
drivers and commands from the RPMs above that I would like kept in the
root image.

The build of the images goes without a complaint. The log files look
reasonable to me. If anyone is unhappy at this point, they are keeping
quite about it.

The kernel and initrd are made available via PXE and tftp. The kernel
command line in my pxeconfig file is:

   DEFAULT KIWI-Boot-serial

   LABEL KIWI-Boot
        kernel rsoft/linux-w-11.2
        append initrd=rsoft/initrd-w-11.2 vga=normal kiwidebug=1
        IPAPPEND 1

The PXE boot works perfectly every time. The kernel loads. The initrd is
accessed and loaded. All seems to proceed correctly and without
complaint to the point where kiwi starts up.

The root partition (which my scripts are defining) is a single image
that kiwi mounts. I have tried NBD and AOE as the image server, and they
both fail at the same place. And this is the odd thing. The failure
seems to move around a bit if I rebuild the images. It may be at one
place in one build. After another rebuild, it may be another place.
Sometimes, if I am lucky, I get a set of images that seem to work great.
But that is less the case than images that fail.

As I can switch between a set of working (boot to completion every time)
and set of not working images (fail in a similar fashion every time), I
am fully convinced that the problem is something in the images
themselves, and not the PXE/NBD/AOE servers. The server is always the
same openSUSE 11.2 system that makes the root image available via NBD
and AOE. I am looking at checking if I can set up another server.

I am testing these images on 6 different PXE clients, representing 3
different sets of hardware. When a failure occurs, all clients will have
the same error. I want to eliminate the client as a source of the
problem.

So, what could I be doing wrong when making the images? Nothing that
makes the build process complain. So it is perhaps not a syntax error.
Could it be a setting of some sort? What setting? When I look through
the three files I described above, I see that I have basically added a
few RPMs and kept a few device drivers. These device drivers are not
loaded (yet). They are present in the root image so that I can
eventually add the code that activates them.

I was tracking the specific points of error. It moves around and I
really could not find a pattern. Almost always it was a complaint about
accessing something in the root image. It would access some things, and
then fail for other things. A very common complaint is:

[   15.640679] EXT3-fs error (device loop0): ext3_get_inode_loc: 
[   15.641127] EXT3-fs error (device loop0): ext3_find_entry: reading directory #4306 offset 0
[   15.641133] Aborting journal on device loop0.
[   15.641147] Buffer I/O error on device loop0, logical block 584
[   15.641149] lost page write due to I/O error on loop0
[   15.641155] ------------[ cut here ]------------

This would lead one to think there is a network problem. I do not think
so. This problem is specific to the images. If I use a 'good' image,
this error never happens. If I use a 'bad' image, it happens all the
time and on all clients in the same way.

My question remains: what is making a bad image bad?
