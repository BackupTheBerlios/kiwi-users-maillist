<PRE>Hi Marcus,

sorry for this late answer, but I'm forced to get up to speed quickly, while 
exercising the flu.. :-(

&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This setup is pretty simple: an installation into a directory is

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One thing you should have in mind is that aufs is not supported by

</I>&gt;<i> anymore. So a concept based on aufs will unfortunately not survive
</I>&gt;<i> very long
</I>
Yes, I know. But the relation between distribution and kernel matters were 
always divergent. Of course, if Al vetoes, Junjiro has a bad stand. And 
Linus seems to be willing to wait, until a union fs comes out of his 
neighborhood from Valerie Aurora (and Jan Blunck). But both seem to be 
busy, thus this project isn't on any fast lane, I fear.

I haven't checked the clicfs appoach, but given the amount of special code, 
that is needed in KIWILinuxRC.sh and suse-linuxrc for it, I'm somewhat 
reluctant.

Funny enough, if aufs goes away, what will kiwi do? It uses it for accessing 
the repos (for unknown reasons..). At least, it does strange things, if 
kiwi cannot load aufs (it leaves strange mount points lying around, which 
need to be mkdir'ed before they can be unmounted again.

&gt;<i> I think you are using aufs because you want to separate the write actions
</I>&gt;<i> per client into a network location which makes sense to me. kiwi could
</I>&gt;<i> arrange your current setup with aufs but I don't recommend to make use
</I>&gt;<i> of it. 
</I>
Okay, as a project maintainer, you have to say that. But I'm happy, if I get 
to the point, where I was in 2005. Unfortunately it isn't all that easy. 
Looks like NFSROOT isn't exercised with UNIONFS_CONFIG setups for some time 
as problems in suse-linuxrc and friends indicate. I'm preparing a separate 
mail for that.

&gt;<i> As an alternative you can think of a clicfs based image with 
</I>&gt;<i> AoE (Ata over Ethernet). It works that way:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - the basic image is a compressed clicfs file which is exported via
</I>&gt;<i>   AoE (vbladed). Each client mounts the exported block device as it's
</I>&gt;<i> root
</I>
Are you sure about clicfs? The usual pattern I found in kiwi and ltsp is 
using a squashfs. Apart from the persistence aspects, I was able to 
exercise this approach the last week, and it seems quick and stable.

Unfortunately, my squashfs image is about 3GB now, and it's creation time is 
hard to stand. More important, I'm loosing some power: serving that bunch 
via NFS, I'm able to apply quick fixes - with mksquashfs in between, it's 
heavily delayed, but I cannot switch the AoE images quickly - I need to 
wait until all clients are shut down. 

&gt;<i> - the copy-on-write actions go to a cow file or into RAM. The location
</I>&gt;<i>   for the cow file can also be an nfs exported rw space. At the moment
</I>&gt;<i>   I have implemented writing to RAM, writing into a cow file on NFS is
</I>&gt;<i>   still missing but can be done in a day
</I>
That sounds interesting, but again, I'm loosing performance, as I do access 
and modify the read-write parts. Is that at least possible with this 
approach? (IOW, is that cow file mountable, examinable and modifyable?)

&gt;<i> &gt; It looks like current technologies in this area are not able to mimic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that fully out of the box. Aufs cannot use a nfs mount for its xino
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; file, and I do not want to give up on the two nfs mounts, either. But I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might want to add nfs or nbd based swap (now, that's available). Looks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like, that I need to use an tmpfs for the xino.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said I wouldn't use aufs at all for a new concept. If the machine
</I>&gt;<i> needs to swap you can use swap over NFS. imho that's fast enough and
</I>&gt;<i> mainframe architectures like s390 does that too :)
</I>
Funnies again, the network filesystem is degraded to paging work, and block 
devices are exported all over the plate. Where in hell is this world 
steering? ;-)

&gt;<i> &gt; It would be kind, if you/someone could give me a few hints, what would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be the best way to realize this with the help of kiwi. Is there an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interest to add this functionality to netboot/suse-11.1, or should I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; create a new image for that. Any pitfalls, I should be aware of?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is always a lot of interest to add something useful for the
</I>&gt;<i> people using kiwi :-) I could add the missing functionality into kiwi
</I>&gt;<i> if you think clicfs and AoE is something you would like to test
</I>&gt;<i> I have that on my plate anyway it's bug: #570960
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 15 seconds wasted for searching some usb devices :-( Whould be cool the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get rid of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm working on that too it's bug: #570961
</I>
Okay, thanks for all these propositions. They're really appreciated, and for 
the sake of it, the responses from Roger and CyberOrg, too. Thanks guys.

Marcus, be prepared for a couple of patches soon..

Thanks again,
Pete
