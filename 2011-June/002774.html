<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Guys as some of you know I'm using a RAM only (live) image.  This
</I>&gt;<i> image &quot;resets&quot; itself on each reboot.  A fat partition is created
</I>&gt;<i> during the build and used for storage that is compatible with Windows.
</I>&gt;<i>  This Fat  partition is mounted to a folder when the user logs in.  So
</I>&gt;<i> the partition storage folder is only available after the user logs in.
</I>&gt;<i> Since this is a ram only live image anything embedded into the image
</I>&gt;<i> is there to stay and anything added to the OS will be lost on the next
</I>&gt;<i> boot.  Because of this I've run into a possible issue in the future
</I>&gt;<i> that may cause an issue.  Since my product is only valid for 1 year I
</I>&gt;<i> only have to be concerned with critical updates within this time
</I>&gt;<i> period.  One of the updates that may be necessary is Adobe Flash
</I>&gt;<i> Player, Java or Adobe Reader.  These products seem to update often and
</I>&gt;<i> may leave a user without the most recent version unable to view or use
</I>&gt;<i> the material on the Web page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was hoping to enable a simple update system for this issue. During
</I>&gt;<i> the creation of the storage folders on the fat partition I have a
</I>&gt;<i> script create a &quot;Updates&quot; directory.  This folder, since it's part of
</I>&gt;<i> the fat partition must be mounted before access. 
</I>
I think I don't understand why it has to be mounted ? imho the
fat partition is mounted to /SOS via some boot script in /etc/init.d
while the machine boots up. Is that correct ? if so /SOS/Updates is just
a directory on the fat partition which should be there as soon as the
fat partition is mounted to /SOS... or did I misunderstand this ?

&gt;<i> This is done at the
</I>&gt;<i> users login.  I've added a simple command line(s) to an existing
</I>&gt;<i> script that runs as root from the /etc/init.d/boot.local script
</I>&gt;<i> however the fat partition isn't mounted yet (the &quot;Updates&quot; folder
</I>&gt;<i> isn't either) so when this script runs it never finds the &quot;Updates&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> folder.
</I>&gt;<i> The command are:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;cd /SOS/SOS_Storage/Updates&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;rpm -i --force *&quot;
</I>
As you have to do that every time the machine boots on a ramonly system
you can add that calls to the script which does the fat mount. You can
be sure to access the fat if the mount did not fail

&gt;<i> The thought was to simply place the updated rpm files (such as
</I>&gt;<i> flash-player) into this folder and anything in this folder would
</I>&gt;<i> simply install at the users login or before it.  This issues of course
</I>&gt;<i> is that this script needs to run as root (or the RPM command needs to
</I>&gt;<i> be able to run as a user) when the user logs in OR the &quot;Updates&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> folder needs to be accessible when the boot.local script runs (before
</I>&gt;<i> the users login).   Is there a kiwi solution for this issue or maybe a
</I>&gt;<i> better approach to this?
</I>
concerning libflashplayer you can place it on the fat partition
and link it from there:

  /usr/lib64/browser-plugins/libflashplayer.so -&gt; /SOS/Updates/libflashplayer.so

In that case you don't have to install it all the time the system
boots up and you can update the flash version without the live system
up and running

Regards,
Marcus
