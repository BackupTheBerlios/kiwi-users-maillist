Hi Marcus, 

Thanks for the pointer. I am trying this out. 

I was checking the build logs and I see the message &quot;Set boot space to: 100&quot; . I am assuming this means that the boot partition size is being set to 100 MB. 

I tried 2 different builds (without the changes that you suggested) where the size of the squashfs partition was different, but the size of the .raw file was exactly the same in both instances. 

Here are my observations. 

Instance 1 : 
Size of squashfs : 700 MB 
Size of .raw : 1.1 GB (1132462080 bytes) 

Instance 2 : 
Size of squashfs : 647 MB 
Size of .raw : 1.1 GB (1132462080 bytes) 

In Instance 2, I had removed some packages in trying to reduce the size of the image. The  interesting part is that the size of .raw file is exactly the same (in terms of bytes) in both the instances.  

I suspect that there is some other place where the size of the .raw file is being defined. This did not happen earlier where I observed that the size of the .raw file would change if the size of squashfs or ext3 filesystems changed. 

With a slightly older version of Kiwi, I was able to build a much smaller size image. 

Regards, 
Rahul

</I>Hi,

&gt;<i> I am trying to build a OEM split image based in SLED 11 SP1 + updates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Earlier I was able to keep the size of the .raw file to approx 900 MB, which could easily fit on a 1 GB Flash.  But now the same .raw file is not coming below 1.1 GB, even though the squashfs filesystem is only 647 MB
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, I am forced to suggest a Flash Disk of 2 GB instead of 1GB, thereby driving up the cost.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have tried changing the value of &quot;spare&quot; from 1.5 to 1.1 (in KIWIImage.pm), but that hasn't helped.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am using kiwi v4.91.2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pls help me in resolving this. I am sure something has changed in the recent versions which is causing this issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me know if you need more details from my side.
</I>
Maybe this is related to the bootsize patch recently added.
In order to allow kernel updates the size of the boot partition
is now bigger. You can try to edit /usr/share/kiwi/modules/KIWIBoot.pm
and search for

   sub __getBootSize

inside __getBootSize you can change $gotMB to something you prefer
but be aware you need at least the size of the /boot data in
your unpacked image tree

Let me know if that helps.

Other than that I'm sure SLED 11 SP1 + updates is bigger than
SLED 11 GA or SLED 11 SP1 without updates.

Regards,
Marcus
