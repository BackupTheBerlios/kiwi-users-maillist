</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that may cause an issue.  Since my product is only valid for 1 year I

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Player, Java or Adobe Reader.  These products seem to update often and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may leave a user without the most recent version unable to view or use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the material on the Web page.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was hoping to enable a simple update system for this issue. During

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> script create a &quot;Updates&quot; directory.  This folder, since it's part of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the fat partition must be mounted before access.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I don't understand why it has to be mounted ? imho the
</I>&gt;<i> fat partition is mounted to /SOS via some boot script in /etc/init.d
</I>&gt;<i> while the machine boots up. Is that correct ?
</I>
Marcus, SOS actually gets mounted during the &quot;automagic&quot; script 
execution when the user is loged in rather than during the init phase. 
The reason for this is that the user needs r/w access to /SOS and if 
/SOS is mounted by root during init the user account cannot write to the 
mounted fat partition.

&gt;<i> if so /SOS/Updates is just
</I>&gt;<i> a directory on the fat partition which should be there as soon as the
</I>&gt;<i> fat partition is mounted to /SOS... or did I misunderstand this ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is done at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> users login.  I've added a simple command line(s) to an existing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> script that runs as root from the /etc/init.d/boot.local script
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> however the fat partition isn't mounted yet (the &quot;Updates&quot; folder
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> isn't either) so when this script runs it never finds the &quot;Updates&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> folder.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The command are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;cd /SOS/SOS_Storage/Updates&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;rpm -i --force *&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you have to do that every time the machine boots on a ramonly system
</I>&gt;<i> you can add that calls to the script which does the fat mount. You can
</I>&gt;<i> be sure to access the fat if the mount did not fail
</I>
Yes, with the exception that he has to first mount /SOS during boot, 
i.e. as root, then apply the updates, then umount /SOS to allow a later 
mount of the fat FS by the user to get user r/w access. Not a big deal 
just a bit of indirection.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The thought was to simply place the updated rpm files (such as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flash-player) into this folder and anything in this folder would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simply install at the users login or before it.  This issues of course
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is that this script needs to run as root (or the RPM command needs to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be able to run as a user) when the user logs in OR the &quot;Updates&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> folder needs to be accessible when the boot.local script runs (before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the users login).   Is there a kiwi solution for this issue or maybe a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better approach to this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> concerning libflashplayer you can place it on the fat partition
</I>&gt;<i> and link it from there:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    /usr/lib64/browser-plugins/libflashplayer.so -&gt;  /SOS/Updates/libflashplayer.so
</I>
Will that softlink work into a fat partition? I've never tried that, 
just wondering.

Later,
Robert
