<PRE>Guys as some of you know I'm using a RAM only (live) image.  This
image &quot;resets&quot; itself on each reboot.  A fat partition is created
during the build and used for storage that is compatible with Windows.
 This Fat  partition is mounted to a folder when the user logs in.  So
the partition storage folder is only available after the user logs in.
Since this is a ram only live image anything embedded into the image
is there to stay and anything added to the OS will be lost on the next
boot.  Because of this I've run into a possible issue in the future
that may cause an issue.  Since my product is only valid for 1 year I
only have to be concerned with critical updates within this time
period.  One of the updates that may be necessary is Adobe Flash
Player, Java or Adobe Reader.  These products seem to update often and
may leave a user without the most recent version unable to view or use
the material on the Web page.

I was hoping to enable a simple update system for this issue. During
the creation of the storage folders on the fat partition I have a
script create a &quot;Updates&quot; directory.  This folder, since it's part of
the fat partition must be mounted before access.  This is done at the
users login.  I've added a simple command line(s) to an existing
script that runs as root from the /etc/init.d/boot.local script
however the fat partition isn't mounted yet (the &quot;Updates&quot; folder
isn't either) so when this script runs it never finds the &quot;Updates&quot;
folder.
The command are:
&quot;cd /SOS/SOS_Storage/Updates&quot;
&quot;rpm -i --force *&quot;

The thought was to simply place the updated rpm files (such as
flash-player) into this folder and anything in this folder would
simply install at the users login or before it.  This issues of course
is that this script needs to run as root (or the RPM command needs to
be able to run as a user) when the user logs in OR the &quot;Updates&quot;
folder needs to be accessible when the boot.local script runs (before
the users login).   Is there a kiwi solution for this issue or maybe a
better approach to this?

</PRE>
