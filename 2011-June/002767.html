<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> The directory is &quot;/SOS&quot;.   This is the mount point for the fat
</I>&gt;<i> partition that I have on this usb flash drive.  This SOS directory is
</I>&gt;<i> sitting empty in my overlay file tree.  The subdirectories that are
</I>&gt;<i> created in the /SOS directory is done with a script that is triggered
</I>&gt;<i> from the /etc/init.d/boot.local script.  I was pointed out by Robert
</I>&gt;<i> that the permissions of the /SOS directory are that the owner (root)
</I>&gt;<i> can read and write but groups and other is read only.  Running the
</I>&gt;<i> chmod command to resolve this (to allow read/write access for groups
</I>&gt;<i> and other) generates no error (as if the command was excepted) however
</I>&gt;<i> the status of the permissions doesn't change.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my config.sh script I have it attempt to change the group and
</I>&gt;<i> ownership of the /SOS directory to the only user on the system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> # Change ownership and group of the /SOS directory
</I>&gt;<i> chown -R my_sos /SOS
</I>&gt;<i> chgrp -R my_sos /SOS
</I>
This doesn't make any sense. Remember below /SOS there is a fat
filesystem. FAT doesn't know anything about user permissions like
unix filesystems does. This means you can call chown and chgrp
but it will not have any effect.

The directory which is representing the mount point of the fat
filesystem (in your case SOS) belongs to linux. You can of course
change the owner and group of that directory. But as soon as
you mount the fat partition at SOS the owner and group will
change back to 'root root' because fat is not capable of that.
As long as it is mounted you will get an error if you try
to change the owner and group of files/directories on the
fat partition. The system will respond with

  chown: changing ownership of `...': Operation not permitted

This is because fat doesn't know about permissions, owner and groups

Hope that helps

Regards,
Marcus
