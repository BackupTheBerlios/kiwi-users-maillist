<PRE>Guys I'm trying to change the ownership and group of a directory.  I
attempted to change the permissions of this directory in a working RAM
only image.  Usually my changes will be applied until I reboot.  This
is a good way for me to test if the command of my script actually
work.
The directory is &quot;/SOS&quot;.   This is the mount point for the fat
partition that I have on this usb flash drive.  This SOS directory is
sitting empty in my overlay file tree.  The subdirectories that are
created in the /SOS directory is done with a script that is triggered
from the /etc/init.d/boot.local script.  I was pointed out by Robert
that the permissions of the /SOS directory are that the owner (root)
can read and write but groups and other is read only.  Running the
chmod command to resolve this (to allow read/write access for groups
and other) generates no error (as if the command was excepted) however
the status of the permissions doesn't change.

In my config.sh script I have it attempt to change the group and
ownership of the /SOS directory to the only user on the system.

# Change ownership and group of the /SOS directory
chown -R my_sos /SOS
chgrp -R my_sos /SOS


 This is necessary because this directory contains storage folders for
the user that remain (on the fat partition) available after a reboot.
 In a working system if I charge to root user and attempt to change
the ownership and group settings of the /SOS directory and it's
contents I appears like it works.  But again the status doesn't
actually change.  How can the permissions/ownership/group be changed
for this directory and it's contents?
Should this /SOS directory not be placed in the overlay file tree and
be created by maybe the config.sh script?   Even setting the ownership
and permissions of the SOS directory in the overlay tree didn't make a
difference.

Thanks
Chris
