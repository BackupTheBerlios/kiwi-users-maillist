<PRE>Hi,

the locale setup in the kiwi config.xml is not meant to setup
a distribution wide language configuration

setting up locale has the following effects:

1) there is always the us locale plus the additional specified
   locales installed as part of the boot image (initrd)

2) the additional locales can be selected inside the graphics
   boot screen. This selection has an effect if there are dialogs
   or license dialogs displayed while the boot process is inside
   the boot image (initrd)

3) the first entry in the locale setup will make it into the
   file /etc/sysconfig/language inside the system image and
   therefore setup the main locale which should be displayed
   if you type 'locale'.

So maybe the section name is misleading but there is no configuration
of your locale and language as required by the desktop, yast2 firstboot
and other services. You have access to the XML locale setup via the
variable $kiwi_language. This allows you to setup the used services
as part of the config.sh script. I hope you understand that there are
many services which requires a locale specific configuration. None
of them use a well defined workflow which makes it nearly impossible to
implement a good way as part of kiwi

&gt;<i> However, my locale settings are completely ignored:
</I>&gt;<i> - on startup, the live image is still booting up in English ( I can
</I>&gt;<i> select German via F2 though )
</I>
correct, that's the intented behavior. gfxboot doesn't allow me to
setup another master language. So I can only add additional ones for
selection

&gt;<i> - if I select &quot;German&quot;, the firstboot still is presented in English
</I>&gt;<i> (although it says &quot;German&quot; as selected default locale/keyboard, timezone
</I>&gt;<i> is set correctly)
</I>
correct, the master locale is German but the services are not configured
This means you might be missing language specific translation packages
and sometimes other configuration files telling the service what it
should do (e.g gnome settings daemon and friends)

&gt;<i> - on first startup, the KDE-Desktop is completely in English, with some
</I>&gt;<i> programs like yast also showing up in German (some modules only)
</I>
most probably missing language packages... I know it's a nightmare ;) 
You can ask Michael Andres &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/kiwi-users">ma at suse.de</A>&gt; for details here. There is a
way to find all language specific packages. You can add them to
your XML description afterwards

&gt;<i> - keyboard is in German, so at least this seems to work
</I>
yes keyboard is a pretty central place and our desktops inherit from
the console keyboard which is good

&gt;<i> What do I have to add to make the default live boot, the firstboot and
</I>&gt;<i> the desktop all come up in German (without having to select F2)?
</I>
I'm not sure if that's possible with the standard gfxboot-branding-openSUSE
package. Maybe you need to recreate the branding package here. But to
be sure you should contact Steffen Winterfeldt &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/kiwi-users">snwint at suse.de</A>&gt;
Let me know what he will tell you, maybe there is a way to address this
better also in kiwi then

If you say... what a mess... I can only agree but it's not kiwi missing
the functionality it's the distribution which doesn't easily allow
to install depending on a language setup. Maybe zypper has added such
a functionality or it's on the plan but so far I know only a yast module
which allows to switch/add languages and also address the package
situation. But still with that in mind I'm sure each desktop has its
own mechanism of handling the language 

Hope that helps

Regards,
Marcus
