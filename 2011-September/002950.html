<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> As you mention that mobile phones etc won't be capable to build a kiwi
</I>&gt;<i> image. I think these devices are the ones that really would need images
</I>&gt;<i> even more the PC's, as an OS on a PC is much easier to install.
</I>
I completely agree here

&gt;<i> In a lot of cases someone who focusses on ARM tablet etc. development
</I>&gt;<i> won't have an ARM server around. So I wonder won't it be an option to
</I>&gt;<i> build the image via qemu-user mode?
</I>
user mode linux should also work in the same way as a virtual machine
solution. OBS uses VM's based on Xen or KVM to build packages and images.
So yes that environment would be perfectly fine to build the images.
for ppc we should be able to do that today because kiwi already supports
building of ppc images. Yury Tsarev &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/kiwi-users">ytsarev at suse.de</A>&gt; added the support
for it. He builds on ppc based blade servers. For arm we still have
the problem that I don't have an rpm based distro at hand. So if I'd
like to do it together with Debian we need to hack kiwi for dpgk and
the boot code. I definitly could need help here
 
&gt;<i> I wouldn't mind waiting longer, to have the image build.
</I>&gt;<i> Are you interested in this. Can I help in any way?
</I>
Help is always pretty much appreciated :) if you want suse for arm
I suggest to join the group who try to build Factory for ARM:

  <A HREF="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=openSUSE%3AFactory%3AARM">https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=openSUSE%3AFactory%3AARM</A>

the stats are pretty disenchanting though

    9 packages
    3073 build errors
    1 open request

This should be the first step for suse on arm.

If you like to go with debian you could help me to create a virtual
disk image for arm including perl,git development tools ready to run
in a VM. If I could download such an image it would be an easier
start for the port. At SuSE there is hackweek this week (unfortunately
the last day today) but for next hackweek my plan is
to setup such an arm development image to be able to start the kiwi
port directly on such a system. But of course it would be great if
there are other people in the community who have interest here

Thanks much for any effort

Regards,
Marcus
