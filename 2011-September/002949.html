Thank you for the answer.

It indeed makes sense. But I still want to bring up a one point.

As you mention that mobile phones etc won't be capable to build a kiwi
image. I think these devices are the ones that really would need images
even more the PC's, as an OS on a PC is much easier to install.
In a lot of cases someone who focusses on ARM tablet etc. development
won't have an ARM server around. So I wonder won't it be an option to
build the image via qemu-user mode? Comparable with how OBS handles it?
I think that same count for PowerPC embedded devices, most people don't
have a PowerPC any more.

I wouldn't mind waiting longer, to have the image build.

Are you interested in this. Can I help in any way?
