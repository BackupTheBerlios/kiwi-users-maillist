<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Is this feeling correct. That the current kiwi version can &quot;only&quot; build
</I>&gt;<i> images for the same architecture as it's running on?
</I>
yes this feeling is correct. I can't tell about other package formats
but at least for rpm it would mean we have to pass the --ignorearch
option which I think can't be added to zypper

In theory I think it would be possible to install everything but kiwi
also does some other tasks which conflicts here. For example scripts
are executed inside the new root tree via chroot. It would cause e.g.
the bash for arch 'x' to be called which surely will not work due to
the incompatible binary format. There might be other problems here
which I did not think about

and that's basically the most important problem I see here.
If I don't have a real machine at hand I will use a VM layer around
and build the image inside that VM contained system. The
downsides:

 1) it's slow
 2) it requires a base distro for that architecture available

Another way to do cross image builds would be to massacre the
environment like a root kit does :) so overloading of libraries
and other hacks might work but frankly said I don't like this
and in the end I'm not sure if that's faster than a VM

Talking about arm:
   
In reference to your other mail talking about arm the second
item mentioned above is a problem at least for SUSE here. The suse
arm port is just beginning and so I was looking around and found
that probably Debian seems to be the best arm supported system
at the moment. In order to let kiwi create Debian images we
have to add support for the dpkg package manager and also for
the boot code (initrd). That surely can be done in a clean way
because the kiwi code base is open for all distros. But I also
would love to see a suse arm core distro available ;)  
 
The other imho more important part is the arm hardware itself.
low end machines like mobile phones and that kind of gadgets are
surely not capable of building operating system images. They are
more the target for the appliances. So it would be nice to have
arm based server hardware which is rare. But it's interesting to
watch the industry here something is going on with arm and server
boards. The cpu emulation in kvm for arm is for a processor
which is not available as a real toy, until then I think a good
start would be to make kiwi work here:

makes sense ?
