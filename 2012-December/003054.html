<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Is there a possibility to make kiwi install its
</I>&gt;<i> unpackaged image tree into an existing directory?
</I>
kiwi supports an oem-partition-install mode along with
the kiwi install images. This mode installs the partitions
of the image into partitions you select. kiwi checks the
slected install disk for free (no filesystem) partitions
and offers you to choose one for root, boot, ... according
to the layout of your image. There are some things you
should know about this mode:

1) it's rarely used

2) the bootloader is setup to boot the kiwi installed system
   Thus the existing systems on this disk cannot be booted
   by the setup kiwi does here. The reason for this is, it's too
   complex to analyse and integrate smoothly here with all
   the different types of loaders. You can use yast2 bootloader
   to rewrite a new bootloader setup. This code is able to
   identify e.g Windows and Linux systems and put them all
   together. I made several tests and it also only worked
   well with pretty simple disk layouts. As soon as the systems
   are spread more complex on the disk also yast will fail.
   Most people have their own scripts to integrate multiple
   systems into one bootloader concept

3) the install disk must be prepared prior to the installation.
   kiwi will not change the existing partition table on the
   selected disk. Thus there need to be at least one Linux
   partition (id=0x83) with no filesystem on board providing
   enough space. If the disk does not offer enough or suitable
   partitions kiwi will try to open a gparted session to let
   you change the table, if the system image does not provide
   gparted and a minimal X system, kiwi will stop with some
   information about the expected partitions, types and sizes

4) existing swap partitions will be re-used
   
You can activate the mode with any oem install CD/DVD Stick by
using the following boot option on the kernel commandline

   OEM_PARTITION_INSTALL=1

Regards,
Marcus
