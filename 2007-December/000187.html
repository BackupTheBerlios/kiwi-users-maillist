<PRE>Hi Marcus,

thanks for the support.

&gt;<i> &gt; I get errors of uninstalled packages when building an image with kiwi.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; At the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; moment I don't know in what direction to search for the error as I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just updated from kiwi-2.01 to 2.07 and have in the meantime also updated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my kiwi image configuration. &#160;So the problem could be caused by either
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [Hmmm, sorry for this lenghty email. &#160;I hope that it does not scare
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people away to read it and answer it!]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your mail I read it and I think one kiwi action might not be
</I>&gt;<i> clear here. When kiwi builds the system image (that's the big 700MB or so
</I>&gt;<i> thing) it also requires to access a method to boot it. In case of an ISO
</I>&gt;<i> image this means kiwi needs to build a boot image too (initrd). The boot
</I>&gt;<i> image descriptions
</I>&gt;<i> comes with the kiwi-desc-*boot packages which installs data in
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/share/kiwi/image/*boot. In your case kiwi picks the boot image to
</I>&gt;<i> boot an ISO live system from /usr/share/kiwi/image/isoboot and
</I>&gt;<i> _automatically_ builds it together with your system image. So what you
</I>&gt;<i> see in the log is a build of a system plus a boot image. The errors
</I>&gt;<i> you found are related to the boot image build.
</I>
Ah, that's clearer now indeed.

&gt;<i> Some words on the errors. The boot image should be as small as possible
</I>&gt;<i> therefore we remove a lot of stuff from this image. The removal of this
</I>&gt;<i> data makes the boot image &quot;inconsistent&quot; in the way the packagemanager and
</I>&gt;<i> some package post scripts thinks about it. The result though is able
</I>&gt;<i> to do the job it should do. The job is &quot;boot the live system&quot; nothing more.
</I>&gt;<i> According to this the errors you found in the log are not fatal because
</I>&gt;<i> we are &quot;breaking&quot; some stuff we don't need intentionally.
</I>
Okay.  The thing is that after upgrading to kiwi-2.07 (from 2.01) it feels 
that the system takes much longer to load the image, which is logical as the 
image is bigger....  (but perhaps the upgrade has nothing to do with it, 
however I still want to mention it ;) )

&gt;<i> fatal is if you can't boot with the result. Mandatory tools like cut
</I>&gt;<i> must be present in the boot image. I'm wondering how I should reproduce
</I>&gt;<i> this because I wasn't able to stumble over that problem.
</I>
Would you mind if I would sent you my config directory?

&gt;<i> - With the latest version there are two examples in /usr/share/doc/kiwi/
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; Could you reproduce your problem with this example image descriptions ?
</I>
I tried example/test2 some days ago (just before posting my email to the ML).  
I was able to boot the resulting image succesfully.  I'll execute a test run 
on test1 in the coming hours (day).

&gt;<i> - A side note. Many people change the boot image descriptions which
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; may lead to unexpected results. Just to make sure you did not change
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; anything in /usr/share/kiwi/image/*boot, did you ? 
</I>
I have not changed anything there.

# rpm -qa &quot;kiwi*&quot; | sort
kiwi-2.07-28.1
kiwi-desc-isoboot-2.07-28.1
kiwi-desc-livesystem-1.55-29.1

# rpm -V kiwi-desc-livesystem kiwi-desc-isoboot
&lt;nothing returned&gt;
So all seems fine, indeed.
