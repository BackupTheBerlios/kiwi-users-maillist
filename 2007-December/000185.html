<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I get errors of uninstalled packages when building an image with kiwi.
</I>&gt;<i> At the 
</I>&gt;<i> moment I don't know in what direction to search for the error as I have just 
</I>&gt;<i> updated from kiwi-2.01 to 2.07 and have in the meantime also updated my kiwi 
</I>&gt;<i> image configuration.  So the problem could be caused by either one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [Hmmm, sorry for this lenghty email.  I hope that it does not scare people 
</I>&gt;<i> away to read it and answer it!]
</I>
Thanks for your mail I read it and I think one kiwi action might not be clear
here. When kiwi builds the system image (that's the big 700MB or so thing)
it also requires to access a method to boot it. In case of an ISO image
this means kiwi needs to build a boot image too (initrd). The boot image
descriptions
comes with the kiwi-desc-*boot packages which installs data in
/usr/share/kiwi/image/*boot. In your case kiwi picks the boot image to
boot an ISO live system from /usr/share/kiwi/image/isoboot and
_automatically_ builds it together with your system image. So what you
see in the log is a build of a system plus a boot image. The errors
you found are related to the boot image build.

Some words on the errors. The boot image should be as small as possible
therefore we remove a lot of stuff from this image. The removal of this
data makes the boot image &quot;inconsistent&quot; in the way the packagemanager and
some package post scripts thinks about it. The result though is able
to do the job it should do. The job is &quot;boot the live system&quot; nothing more.
According to this the errors you found in the log are not fatal because
we are &quot;breaking&quot; some stuff we don't need intentionally.

fatal is if you can't boot with the result. Mandatory tools like cut
must be present in the boot image. I'm wondering how I should reproduce
this because I wasn't able to stumble over that problem.

- With the latest version there are two examples in /usr/share/doc/kiwi/
  Could you reproduce your problem with this example image descriptions ?

- A side note. Many people change the boot image descriptions which
  may lead to unexpected results. Just to make sure you did not change
  anything in /usr/share/kiwi/image/*boot, did you ?

Regards,
Marcus
