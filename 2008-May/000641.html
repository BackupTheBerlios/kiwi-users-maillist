<PRE>Hi Marcus,
&gt;<i> Hi Bernd,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hmm, this is quite different from most other distributions, where the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bootable partition can be FAT16 or FAT32, so to improve booting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with syslinux on broken BIOS systems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh that remembers me that you told me to have a look into isolinux
</I>&gt;<i> as alternative boot loader for the USB sticks. I'm sorry I didn't
</I>&gt;<i> thought that a single boot partition based on FAT is also &quot;required&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> here. 
</I>Well, I think I wanted to write the .pm for syslinux, but I did not find 
the time yet.
&gt;<i> The reason for not having a single /boot partition has happened
</I>&gt;<i> because of size reasons. Together with the partition alignment and 
</I>&gt;<i> the filesystem overhead this was requested by some people which was
</I>&gt;<i> the reason why we changed it. Frankly said it also sounds rather
</I>&gt;<i> weird to fix BIOS bugs by the geometry of a boot partition :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I am not sure if we fix BIOS bugs or prevent grub from doing something 
wrongly.
We are living in a real world with real customers, and they tell us that 
the failure
for booting with grub is around 15-20% and the failure with syslinux is 
only a fraction.
So what should I do - using syslinux over grub sounds more reasonable 
than trying
to convince people to buy a new mainboard or flash their BIOS..
&gt;&gt;<i> Of course we could always use extlinux, but grub is AFAIK not the best 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> choice for booting a USB device.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's what I have heared too. Some people point me to grub2 which
</I>&gt;<i> should be better ?
</I>I haven't had a chance to try this yet, is this package in opensuse 11?
&gt;<i>  I agree it would make sense to have alternative
</I>&gt;<i> boot loaders available. At the moment this is only grub which also
</I>&gt;<i> sucks for ppc and other archs. A clean implementation which leaves
</I>&gt;<i> us the choice for either a) or b) would be the best I think. Perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> the perl-bootloader module could help us to implement that in a
</I>&gt;<i> clean way. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Probably the real work has been already done with the isolinux 
bootloader for CDs/DVDs.
I think all we need to do is use the code there and modify it a bit - 
but I don't understand
enough about the internal architecture of kiwi to be able to use it in a 
clean way.
I could hack some spaghetti code to make it work very quickly, but you 
won't like this ;-)
&gt;&gt;<i> Also, putting the boot section into the writeable partition has the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disadvantage that you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cannot &quot;reset&quot; the USB stick to factory defaults by just formatting the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> third partition with ext3 ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, sorry I think I don't get the point. The original /boot information
</I>&gt;<i> can be preserved as compressed data on the read-only partition. In case
</I>&gt;<i> of resetting these values they can be obtained from there
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>The stick created with 2.38-61 looks like this:
part1   squashfs
part2   ext3/aufs
The boot information is in part2. So if I format part2, booting 
information will disappear.
Previously, booting information was in part1, squashfs in part2 and 
ext3/aufs was in part3.
So when formatting part3, I could reset the stick to factory defaults?
I think a cleaner approach might have been to have part1 containing the 
squashfs+boot loader stuff,
so part2 only contains user data and no vital system information.
But I'm not sure if there is a performance penalty if squashfs doesn't 
have it's own partition and is
just another file on a FatNN/extN partition. And this approach might not 
be suitable for LTSP or VMs.
