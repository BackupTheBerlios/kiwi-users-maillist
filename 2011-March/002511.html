<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> In the file manager after the first boot the 300mb partition shows up,

Sorry for not being clear.  Simply put my notebook test machine when
running the Live OS on the USB stick is able to access and display in
the file manager the fat (300mb) partition as well as the existing
hard drive partitions yet on my desktop test machine the fat partition
nor the existing hard drive is assessable or viewable from the file
manager.  I actually can't located the fat partition at all on this
machine.  How can the same image (flash drive) on one machine show
different results than another?  Nothing changed in terms of the
image.

Thanks Marcus very much for the help with the script for automount.
This will help as I started working on this script last night.

Based on what Robert suggest do you guys think that your re-instate
the &lt;type image=&quot;usb&quot;....&gt; element or do you think this recent change
will suffice?
Chris
