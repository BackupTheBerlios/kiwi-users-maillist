<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Marcus and Robert
</I>&gt;<i> as you guys know I am working on a project that stores a live image on
</I>&gt;<i> a usb flash drive.  I'm having issues when streaming flash  video that
</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't cache fast enough.  At least that's what it seems.  At
</I>&gt;<i> first the videos seem to play okay but the longer it runs the worst it
</I>&gt;<i> gets until it not only won't play but the browser (firefox) is
</I>&gt;<i> unresponsive.  Just bookmarking a site takes forever.  The browser is
</I>&gt;<i> completely overwhelmed by the video trying to play.  I understand that
</I>&gt;<i> USB drives in general do have different bandwidth capabilities and the
</I>&gt;<i> one I'm using isn't the fastest one around but it's not the slowest
</I>&gt;<i> either.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I changed the swap element in the config.xml file from 800 to 2000 it
</I>&gt;<i> did seem to make a bit of a difference but didn't resolve the issue.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there anything else that many help with this issue?  Maybe the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ramonly&quot; element?
</I>
my guess is that you are running out of ram space. You should have
in mind that you requested a live OS on stick which is compressed
and also doesn't allow any persistent data. This means that OS
has to do some decompression which costs CPU and bandwidth power
and all write actions go to RAM which means you have less RAM
than you might expect. If the video stream starts to slow down
at a certain point in time I guess that the system now starts
swapping which makes that kind of live OS probably pretty
unresponsive

I don't have a good solution here. You should make sure the OS
runs on a machine with lots of RAM and the stick hardware
is fast. kiwi uses 7/10 of the ram space according to

  /proc/meminfo | grep MemFree

Regards,
Marcus
