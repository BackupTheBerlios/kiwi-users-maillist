</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You can specify the package name including the version number, i.e.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;package name=&quot;blah-1.2.3&quot;/&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, be aware that if the upstream package changed the older version may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have disappeared from the repo.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Geesss can there be any more variables?!
</I>
Welcome to release management.

&gt;<i> So what is the cure for this issue?  I mean if an image is designed
</I>&gt;<i> around certain packages and my packages are based off the original
</I>&gt;<i> SUSE versions of them how do I avoid having issue when somebody
</I>&gt;<i> updates the SUSE packages that mine are based from?
</I>
You can always keep a copy of the original packages in you own OBS 
project. When you link a package from another project you have the 
option to track the changes in the originating project or not.

&gt;<i> All I want to do is have a consistent base to build from.
</I>
Don't include devel repositories from OBS, be careful which update repos 
you include. Based on your earlier description I would say you are 
probably pulling packages from a devel repo.

If you stick to 11.x and 11.x update repos changes as you describe them 
should not happen. You have got to develop an understanding of how 
projects in OBS work and what their package update policy is, as well as 
getting an understanding about how the moving pieces fit together. Based 
on that you need to be mindful about the repositories you configure in 
config.xml.

&gt;<i> Should I be
</I>&gt;<i> making my branding package in such as way that they don't depend on
</I>&gt;<i> anything else?
</I>
Not necessarily, you just have to look at your dependencies and evaluate 
what the effects of changes might be. If you think there might be 
adverse effects you can lock down the dependency on a specific version.

Requires: blah = 0.9.9

instead of using

Requires: blah &gt;= 0.9.9

or

Requires: blah

&gt;<i> It just seems for every step forward that I make I
</I>&gt;<i> take 4 steps backwards due to unforeseen changes or issues.  Don't get
</I>&gt;<i> me wrong I'm learning alot and have a long way to go in that area but
</I>&gt;<i> time wise this is killing me.
</I>
Well, it appears to me that you're in way over your head. You jumped off 
the cliff and are now flying by the seat of your pants. This mode of 
learning can be very frustrating, but it can also be very rewarding. It 
is in any event more time consuming than a more methodical approach.

Anyway,

&gt;<i> Am I doing something wrong?
</I>
no, not necessarily. You just need to get your head around how the 
various pieces of the puzzle fit together and be more mindful of your 
dependencies and where you pull things from to create your image.

Later,
Robert
