</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see your point Robert.  The script that Marcus wrote is working
</I>&gt;<i> well.  It's just a matter of disabling the automount that is currently
</I>&gt;<i> happening.  But where the config file that is telling the OS to
</I>&gt;<i> automount the fat partition is beyond me.  I can't find it! It's not
</I>&gt;<i> part of /etc/fstab....
</I>
/etc/fstab is responsible for things that are &quot;permanent&quot; or anything 
you want mounted during init when 'mount -a' gets run. THus it would not 
come into play in your case.

&gt;<i> I'm assuming that the script responsible is
</I>&gt;<i> located in the users profile and not in a global location like
</I>&gt;<i> /etc...but it where?
</I>
NO, there should be a global configuration as well. However, I have no 
idea where LXDE keeps global configuration, for GNOME settings like this 
are stored in /etc/gconf/, the LXDE folks should be able to help you 
find the setting.

&gt;<i> It only mounts the fat partition which is the
</I>&gt;<i> first partition on the USB flash drive...any other partitions (like
</I>&gt;<i> ones on an existing hard drive installed on the machine) don't mount.
</I>&gt;<i> So it as to be looking for the fat partition to mount it...right?
</I>
Don't know the rules they follow for LXDE, my guess would be that it is 
filesystem independent and rather triggered by a partition on the same 
device, i.e. if your storage partition were ext3 it would still get mounted.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The verbose mode is on every boot not just the first one...but I
</I>&gt;<i> disabled that in the config file and rebuilt the image and it seems to
</I>&gt;<i> work in normal bootspash mode now.
</I>
Than I am missing something :( what does /boot/grub/menu.lst look like? 
You should have splash=silent on the &quot;kernel&quot; line.

Taking a look at making the initial verbosity configurable.

Robert
