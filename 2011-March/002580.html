</I>Thanks Marcus,
Ok I fully understand what your saying.  If the &quot;ramonly&quot; setting is
changed to 'false' isn't the image still a &quot;live&quot; image?   I mean that
live images are read only anyway right?  So would that change the fact
that currently the os is sort of &quot;resets&quot; back to the original image
when the system is rebooted?   If the &quot;ramonly&quot; element was changed
would the OS then be able to save the changes made by a user?

Since the fat partition can only be done with and OEM image and not
with an ISO that limits me to using the OEM image...which I really
like and think it's the way to go. Especially with the modes to Kiwi
to allow a Windows friendly fat storage partition.  The CD rom version
of the live image doesn't seem to be effected by this issue.  That
must be also storing it's cache in RAM as well, no?

Why do the CD ROM live image not seem to have this issue?
