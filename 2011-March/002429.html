Erich,
Interesting stuff.  How are you getting the file that you place on the
USB drive.  The ones you listed I mean.  Did you run kiwi to generate
an the image (what type exactly?) and then copy the file directly to
the USB drive?

Robert,
I've tried everything that I know to make this work and nothing seems
to work. Either the USB drive won't boot or it will boot and Windows
can't see the partition.  I've even tried formatting the drive with
Windows as Fat and then copying the boot file to the drive
manually....nothing works.
You mentioned about adding this &quot;--fatstorage&quot; option to kiwi.  How
would this be implemented into kiwi?  I assume this will take months
to implement into Kiwi correct?  What and how will this do what we
need and is it possible to manually produce whatever Kiwi would be
modified to do and have it work now?

I saw the bug that was filed on this. Thanks :)

I'm not sure what to do on this. This is at least the 5th time that
I've run into a problem that seems to be rather unique to my
project(s).

In your opinion what is the best kiwi option for what I'm trying to
do?  Most of the time with all of these test I'm making my image with
kiwi as an ISO.  Then I'm dd that image to the drive.  I've haven't
been successful in using kiwi to deploy the image to the drive.  So
now that know the issues as far as the fat partition needing to be
first on the drive and the if the ISO image also isn't first it seems
not to be able to boot from it, what image type should be used with
kiwi?

I realize at this stage nothing will work until Kiwi is modified to be
able to create the Win space by itself... but what about Erich's
approach to this?  Although I'm not sure how he got the files in the
first place and how they were moved/copied to the USB drive it seem
like this works for him.  Any idea if this approach would work for my
purposes?

I think the goal for my project is that it would be idea to have a Fat
partition for storage (both in Linux and WIndows) but when looking at
the drive in Windows to not be able to &quot;see&quot; the Linux partition at
all.  Since the Linux image is a live image this partition doesn't
show up at all when running the Linux live image...that's a good
thing.  I assume that Windows may not see the Linux partition anyway
because it's not a format that Windows can understand anyway.  How far
off am I on this?

Chris
