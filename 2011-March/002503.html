</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> boots, the link is gone after reboot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another reason for this is, you can't update the kernel while
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> running a ram-only OS. /boot would be persistently writable for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such an update but all the modules the new kernel will bring in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be stored in RAM and are therefore gone on reboot. According
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to this you wouldn't be able to boot the system after such an update
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which is also a reason why we don't mount the boot partition to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /boot (/lvmboot) inside the live-os if it's ram-only

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Marcus
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;/boot or /lvmboot is a bad location for this because those
</I>&gt;<i> directories are created on first boot of the OS. Having that said
</I>&gt;<i> you can't place files in root/boot/... of your overlay tree in
</I>&gt;<i> your image description because they will not show up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To my knowledge KDE4 .desktop files are stored in the users
</I>&gt;<i> home directory. So copy your .desktop file into the home directory
</I>&gt;<i> of the desired user in the overlay tree:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;cd &lt;image-description&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;cd root
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;mkdir -p /home/&lt;user-name&gt;/.local/share/applications/
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;cp &lt;icon-name&gt;.desktop /home/&lt;user-name&gt;/.local/share/applications/&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok actually I'm using LXDE/Openbox for this project but no matter I
</I>&gt;<i> can find what talking about.
</I>&gt;<i> I did already make the .desktop file..but to what does this .desktop
</I>&gt;<i> file actually point too that will be there after the first boot?
</I>&gt;<i> I noticed after the first boot that the USB fat partition mounts in
</I>&gt;<i> /media. &#160;Actually with this particular USB drive the path is
</I>&gt;<i> /media/910E-c98C. &#160; Ok so I can't point the .desktop file at that
</I>&gt;<i> specific path because the &quot;910E-c98C&quot; part of the path will
</I>&gt;<i> change/vary with different USB drives...so what can I point this
</I>&gt;<i> .desktop file at that will be consistent with any USB drive? &#160; I
</I>&gt;<i> didn't just want to point it at /media because in the media location
</I>&gt;<i> (which is the only location that it appears that the fat partition is
</I>&gt;<i> accessible from) there is a &quot;boot&quot; directory along with a file
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ldlinux.sy&quot;. &#160;I really would hope to avoid have the end user being
</I>&gt;<i> placed here. &#160; I was hoping to create the &quot;Storage&quot; folder on the fat
</I>&gt;<i> partition and have the .desktop file point at it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also after the second boot the file manager now shows the mounted fat
</I>&gt;<i> partition as &quot;325 MB Filesystem&quot;. &#160;Is this label for this editable?
</I>&gt;<i> Is this a Kiwi changeable thing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The last question is what would be the behavior if i changed kiwi's
</I>&gt;<i> element &quot;ramonly=&quot;true&quot;&quot; to &quot;false&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Chris
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Why with the OEM type image is the first boot with image any different
than any other boot?  With the ISO type image every boot is the
same...right?  How is it with a Live image using and OEM image type
that it &quot;knows&quot; that it's the first time it's being ran compared to
any other time the image is booted?
So that means if I configured that .desktop file on the users Desktop
to point a /media   that should work but on after the first boot and
not the first?

In the file manager after the first boot the 300mb partition shows up,
along with the any other partition that is available, such as the
existing hard drive of the computer this live USB image is running on.
 The strange thing is now that we switched the config for this image
from an ISO to and OEM my other test machine (on first or there after
boot) doesn't show this fat partition in file manager nor does it show
the existing hard drive of this test machine.  In fact I can find the
fat partition on this other test machine at all.  It's not in /media
and and there is no lxboot dir...This is killing me!  Any idea how one
machine can show a different results than another using the same
image?
Chris
