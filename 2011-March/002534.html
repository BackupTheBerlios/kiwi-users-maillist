<PRE>Hi,
I had a bit of a mishap the other day where my config.xml file had
been deleted to the trash bin while deleting other files.  I restored
the config.xml file by confirming the time/date to make sure I had the
correct version of this file.  As far as I could tell it was the
correct one.
However after running kiwi to create a new image and testing that
image I notice an issue with two package that were previously resolved
before this &quot;delete/restore&quot; issue.

If you guys remember I had an issue with the package
lxde-common-branding-openSUSE conflicting with my version of this
package.  The issue was related to a conflict string in the spec file.
 I was unsuccessful in getting the maintainer of this package to
remove this string so Marcus recommended a few options.  Based on
these options I choose to have my package(s) stored locally in the
image (within the overlay file tree) and using the config.sh file to
remove the SUSE version and install my branded version of this file.
Up until now this worked great.  However it isnt' working now and I'm
out of things to look at to find the source of the problem.

The lxde-common-branding-openSUSE package provides some images for
logout, menus and script to logout and login.  My package provides the
same exact items and deps.  The config.sh  script has:

# Activate services
#--------------------------------------
suseActivateDefaultServices
suseInsertService boot.device-mapper

#unistallation of the Suse branding package leaving the deps behind
and installing SOS branding in it's place.
rpm -e --nodeps lxde-common-branding-openSUSE-11.3-54.2.noarch
rpm -i /opt/SOS/lxde-common-branding-SOS-11.3-32.1.noarch.rpm
rpm -e --nodeps desktop-data-openSUSE-11.3-1.3.noarch
rpm -i /opt/SOS/desktop-data-SOS-11.3-15.1.noarch.rpm
rm -rf /opt/SOS

which uninstalls the SUSE version and installs my branded version of
theses package.  It always worked before.   Now when I an working in
this image I can see that the menu and logout images are not correct.
I CD over to /usr/share/lxde/images (in this recently built image) and
sure enough the SUSE image are still there.  So by the looks of it the
config.sh script isn't running because when I do a &quot;rpm -e --nodeps
lxde-common-branding-openSUSE-11.3-54.2.noarch&quot; manually in a terminal
it removes all the image and scripts on the system related to the SUSE
version of this package.  I then tried to install my version of the
package which is in /opt/SOS with the same command that the config.sh
script is running which is &quot;rpm -i
/opt/SOS/lxde-common-branding-SOS-11.3-32.1.noarch.rpm&quot; and it's
indicating &quot;failed dependencies: desktop-data-openSUSE is need by
lxde-common-branding-SOS&quot;   Since when?!
I'm guessing maybe this isn't an issue at all with the package as this
all worked fine up until the deletion and restore of my config.xml
file.
I've been trying to figure out what happened to cause this for over a
day now and can't seem to figure out what happend.  Here is the
config.xml file <A HREF="http://paste.opensuse.org/79011903">http://paste.opensuse.org/79011903</A>

Thanks guys for any help with this.
chris
