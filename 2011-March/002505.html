&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why with the OEM type image is the first boot with image any different
</I>&gt;<i> than any other boot?
</I>
Because for an OEM image Kiwi creates a virtual disk image that is then 
written to the target device (the USB stick in your case). This virtual 
disk image takes up the minimum space possible (plus a small buffer). 
Upon first boot the disk image needs to expand to accommodate the true 
disk geometry of the target device, otherwise you would ot be able to 
write any data to the disk.

Now, in your case where everything happens in ram, due to the &quot;ramfs&quot; 
value the expansion step could be skipped as we do not need to have 
space for write operations. With &quot;ramfs&quot; we end up with a special case 
of OEM. :(

Marcus,

I would advocate to go back to having &lt;type image=&quot;usb&quot;....&gt; and 
implement as a special case of OEM, rather than have the OEM boot 
process behave differently, depending on whether &quot;ramfs&quot; is set or not. 
No good deed shall go unpunished ;)

&gt;<i> With the ISO type image every boot is the
</I>&gt;<i> same...right?
</I>
Yes, because an ISO image cannot change.

&gt;<i> How is it with a Live image using and OEM image type
</I>&gt;<i> that it &quot;knows&quot; that it's the first time it's being ran compared to
</I>&gt;<i> any other time the image is booted?
</I>
An OEM image is really an image within an image. The first image is a 
live system that has an auto-installer that installs the image onto the 
target device. Caveat, I haven't looked at the new code in detail and 
haven't build a new image type, we might skip the &quot;install&quot; step, but 
clearly some code of the general OEM initrd is shared with the special 
case OEM.

&gt;<i> So that means if I configured that .desktop file on the users Desktop
</I>&gt;<i> to point a /media   that should work but on after the first boot and
</I>&gt;<i> not the first?
</I>
My first reaction would be that this should always work, but I could be 
mistaken.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the file manager after the first boot the 300mb partition shows up,
</I>&gt;<i> along with the any other partition that is available, such as the
</I>&gt;<i> existing hard drive of the computer this live USB image is running on.
</I>
This is governed by the &quot;automount&quot; rules of your desktop environment.

&gt;<i>   The strange thing is now that we switched the config for this image
</I>&gt;<i> from an ISO to and OEM my other test machine (on first or there after
</I>&gt;<i> boot) doesn't show this fat partition in file manager nor does it show
</I>&gt;<i> the existing hard drive of this test machine.  In fact I can find the
</I>&gt;<i> fat partition on this other test machine at all.  It's not in /media
</I>&gt;<i> and and there is no lxboot dir...This is killing me!  Any idea how one
</I>&gt;<i> machine can show a different results than another using the same
</I>&gt;<i> image?
</I>
Sorry I am confused in the text leading up to your question you imply 
that the behavior is different between OEM and ISO image, then in your 
question you say that the behavior is different for the same image.

????

Later,
Robert
