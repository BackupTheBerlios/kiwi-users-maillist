</I>&gt;<i> 1. Bootinclude attribute: Does this mean that kiwi will modify the raw boot image and installs new packages into it?
</I>
No.

&gt;<i> Or does it mean that when kiwi builds the boot image (as a subroutine while building the system image) that it will add those packages at that time?
</I>
Yes, building the initrd (boot image) currently happens via recursive 
call of kiwi onto itself with the parameter set such the control file of 
the specified boot image is found. With this a prepare and create step 
is run to create the initrd. packages and archives marked as 
&quot;bootinclude&quot; get bundled up in the initrd.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To put another way, if I prebuild my boot image, will setting the &quot;bootinclulde&quot; attribute in my system image config.xml have any effect?
</I>
Marcus will need to answer that one.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Bootdelete attribute: The function of this is [mostly] clear to me, but I don't understand the use case. For example, branding packages are marked as bootdelete=&quot;true&quot;, but why?
</I>
Because we do not want the package itself, we want the installed 
content. bootdelete=true gets rid of the package, i.e. the rpm file, 
also applies to archives.

&gt;<i> Aren't they needed in the final boot image?
</I>
Yes, tey are, but we are interested in the installed content, not the 
package itself.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. I am trying to set up branding by putting my artwork and configurations in the overlay (bootsplash in etc/bootsplash... and gfxboot in usr/share/gfxboot...). Is that a mistake?
</I>
No, this is possible. You can find an example here:

<A HREF="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:KIWI_Cookbook_Splash_Screen">http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:KIWI_Cookbook_Splash_Screen</A>

The example uses an archive, but you can create the setup directly in 
the overlay tree.

&gt;<i> Does branding need to be deployed as an RPM in order to work?
</I>
No, it does not, see example above.

&gt;<i> (I am including gfxboot and bootsplash in my system image, but not including any gfxboot-branding-* or bootsplash-branding-*).
</I>
Don't forget to set &lt;boot-theme&gt; in config.xml and make sure you use a 
directory other than the default.

HTH,
Robert
