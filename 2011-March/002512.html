<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Sorry for not being clear.  Simply put my notebook test machine when
</I>&gt;<i> running the Live OS on the USB stick is able to access and display in
</I>&gt;<i> the file manager the fat (300mb) partition as well as the existing
</I>&gt;<i> hard drive partitions yet on my desktop test machine the fat partition
</I>&gt;<i> nor the existing hard drive is assessable or viewable from the file
</I>&gt;<i> manager.  I actually can't located the fat partition at all on this
</I>&gt;<i> machine.  How can the same image (flash drive) on one machine show
</I>&gt;<i> different results than another?  Nothing changed in terms of the
</I>&gt;<i> image.
</I>
What you are saying is that if you turn off your notebook, plugg off
the USB stick, put it in your desktop machine , switch on your desktop
machine and boot from the stick, then you can't see the fat partition ?
Well I'm sure it's still there otherwise the boot from USB would have
failed. So if that's true than I only can imagine a problem with
the automounter but on a ramonly image no information of the system
before has been stored. So I'm still confused

&gt;<i> Based on what Robert suggest do you guys think that your re-instate
</I>&gt;<i> the &lt;type image=&quot;usb&quot;....&gt; element or do you think this recent change
</I>&gt;<i> will suffice?
</I>
the image=&quot;usb&quot; is gone and won't come back. You can have entirely
the same thing with the oem type and more. I don't see a reason to
maintain two code bases where one is just an extraction of the other.
Basically usb has survived only for the reason to create a custom
partition table which allows to have another partition than the
root partition as first partition. The only reason people requesting
this was to be able to use the stick as OS _and_ as data container
on Windows and Linux. Exactly that has been achieved with the recent
changes to the oem type. What most people dislike with the usb
type was that you need linux and kiwi to deploy the image on the
stick. One had to plug in the stick and call kiwi --bootstick in
order to deploy to the stick. So the type really wasn't very
popular and almost all people prefer to use imageWriter which also
brings you back to the oem or iso type

Regards,
Marcus
