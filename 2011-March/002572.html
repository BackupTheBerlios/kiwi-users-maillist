<PRE>Guys I'm trying to run two scripts.  One a login and one at logout or
halt/shutdown.  I did get the shut down script to run by adding the
command to (trigger the script) the /etc/init.rd/halt.local.
However I've tried every way that I know how to trigger this script to
run upon login and it hasn't ran once.
Attempts include
 1) creating a .desktop file in the ~/.config/autostart that points to
the script.  When I click on this .desktop file it will run the script
no problem.  If I run the command for the script manually it will also
run no problem.
2) I've added the script directly to the ~/config/autostart
folder....didn't work
3) I've added the command for the script directly to the
/etc/init.rd/boot.local...didn't work
4) I've renamed the scripts with a &quot;.sh&quot; extension....didn't work.

Oddly I have a .desktop file (located in the ~/config/autostart
folder) that exec a script for auto locating and mounting the fat
partition on the flash drive and this same script changes the Windows
attributes so certain files and folders are hidden when viewed in
windows.  The strange thing is that the part of the script that
locates and mounts the fat partition ALWAYS works...and the hiding
(for Windows) of the &quot;boot&quot; folder...always works also.  However there
is another file (located in the same exact directory as the &quot;boot&quot;
folder)  that only is hidden after booting the image a second time.
I've tried adding my Windows attributes parts before the fat locating
and mount section...I've tried many things be it still only seems to
hide this other file after two boots of the image.    I have no idea
what is going on here but I was wondering if there might be a better
way to run a login script.  Can Kiwi help?

</PRE>
