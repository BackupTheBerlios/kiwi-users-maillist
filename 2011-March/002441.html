<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> It's important but not to the point where I can't wait until Friday
</I>&gt;<i> that's for sure.  Thanks for asking. I would rather have you do
</I>&gt;<i> what you feel
</I>
I feel it's better to have some testing and maybe find some
other bugs :-)

&gt;<i> you need too to ensure it's tested and working correctly.
</I>
I count on you to test it :) and if it sucks we fix it again...

&gt;<i> I'll wait until Friday.  I am currently running kiwi 4.43-1.6.  The
</I>&gt;<i> version that will be available on Friday will replace this version and
</I>&gt;<i> be in the same repos as the existing version (not in a testing repo)?
</I>
The version I will submit is 4.81 and will be at the usual
place here:

   <A HREF="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Virtualization:/Appliances">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Virtualization:/Appliances</A>

&gt;<i> Thanks Marcus.  I can't tell you how much I appreciate your efforts on
</I>&gt;<i> this issue.
</I>
He He we want happy users and personally I want to create
something useful. So your report was very important because
it showed me a use case I didn't know about. Basically kiwi
should support what people need and even if there are other
nice image types and modes it should be able to create
what people need in the first place. So don't hesitate to
tell us

&gt;<i> Is Kiwi your project?  You really know it well huh?
</I>
yep, my baby :-) but I received very good feedback and contributions
from other people. I really appreciate that because it keeps
a project alive

Thanks to everyone

Regards,
Marcus
