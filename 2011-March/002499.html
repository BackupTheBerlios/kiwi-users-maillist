<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Ok here is my next question.
</I>&gt;<i> I boot the live os from the drive.  Located the /lvmboot directory as
</I>&gt;<i> this seems to be the Windows accessible fat file system).  I Created a
</I>&gt;<i> .desktop file that points to this directory and it works.  I would
</I>&gt;<i> however like to create a folder within this directory name
</I>&gt;<i> whatever.... &quot;Storage&quot; and have the .desktop file point to this folder
</I>&gt;<i> specifically.  In the config.sh script I added a line that reads
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;mkdir -p /lvmboot/Storage&quot; but it doesn't actually create the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Storage&quot; folder/dir within the lvmboot directory.  Is there another
</I>&gt;<i> way to create this dir?  I don't see the exists of this lvmboot dir in
</I>&gt;<i> the unpacked directory...so what's my alternative?
</I>
/boot or /lvmboot is a bad location for this because those
directories are created on first boot of the OS. Having that said
you can't place files in root/boot/... of your overlay tree in
your image description because they will not show up.

To my knowledge KDE4 .desktop files are stored in the users
home directory. So copy your .desktop file into the home directory
of the desired user in the overlay tree:

   cd &lt;image-description&gt;
   cd root
   mkdir -p /home/&lt;user-name&gt;/.local/share/applications/
   cp &lt;icon-name&gt;.desktop /home/&lt;user-name&gt;/.local/share/applications/

That's it. I'm sorry I don't know how to setup that on Gnome if
you use that desktop you might ask the gnome people

&gt;<i> A few other things that I noticed.  On the first boot of the USB live
</I>&gt;<i> image it would read [OEM] next to the image titile in the grub boot
</I>&gt;<i> screen...other times that &quot;OEM&quot; wouldn't show up.
</I>
this is correct and intentional. The title name _after_ first boot
is the one you set in the config.xml as displayname=&quot;...&quot; the little
[ OEM ] tells people this is the first time that appliance boots

&gt;<i> Also I booted another time and the /lvmboot directory wasn't there in
</I>&gt;<i> the file tree at all (on the live image) but the USB fat partition was
</I>&gt;<i> mounted in /media? What the heck is going on here?
</I>
This is also correct and the reason is because you want a ram-only
system by intention and that means everything written on first boot
will vanish after the second boot. As the lvmboot is just a bind link
to your fat partition created on first boot to setup all subsequent
boots, the link is gone after reboot

Regards,
Marcus
