<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Thanks Marcus. I guess I don't understand what a prebuilt boot image is. I thought this would save some time when building my system image by not building the same boot image over and over. Is that not the case?
</I>
This is the case. If the prebuilt boot image is there kiwi doesn't have
to build it and that saves time. But it would be bad if kiwi would accept
any kind of boot image because if the boot image (initrd + kernel) doesn't
fit to the the later system image nothing will work. That's the reason
why the image description which at some point has built the boot image
must be accessable to check some things before we accept the prebuilt
version. And that's the reason why kiwi need the location of that boot
image description which it get from the boot=&quot;...&quot; attribute

&gt;<i> Part of the problem is that the boot image step happens after the physical-&gt;logical step, which itself takes almost 10 minutes. So it's taking a long time for me to try alternative configurations. I'm just about to give up on it.
</I>
I'm afraid but somehow all the data must become part of the image.
If the image is a virtual disk the boot image is some part of it and
has to be copied into that disk (over a loop device) I can't prevent
this action so yes there is still some time required for building even
if you have a prebuilt boot image at hand.

imho the performance win of using a prebuilt boot image is pretty
high The studio web service also makes use of it

&gt;<i> The documentation doesn't really make this obvious when it says, &quot;all of the
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned types **can** specify the boot attribute which tells KIWI to call
</I>&gt;<i> itself to build the requested boot image (initrd).&quot; Should be &quot;must&quot; instead of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;can&quot;.
</I>
There are other image types which doesn't require a boot image.
For example if you only want to create a filesystem image the
following type is used:

   &lt;type image=&quot;ext3&quot;/&gt;

in that case you don't need to create a boot image so the &quot;can&quot;
is not entirely wrong but I agree the docs could be very much
improved here

Regards,
Marcus
