<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Hmmm  I have to try to get this to work otherwise this project is a
</I>&gt;<i> total waste of time.
</I>
Sometimes this happens ;)

&gt;<i> I'm almost positive that Matt (the author of Image Writer) told me
</I>&gt;<i> that this would work.  Today I'm going to look at my notes on what he
</I>&gt;<i> said (3 months ago) and see if he recommended to do anything different
</I>&gt;<i> to achieve what I'm looking for.
</I>
Matt suggested to create a usb image instead of a hybrid iso.
This indeed can be a solution because along with the usb image
type you use the &quot;kiwi --bootstick ...&quot; call which deploys directly
to your stick. Problem ist the current code doesn't support to
create a data partition as part of this deployment

&gt;<i> When plug in this USB drive into a Linux machine the storage partition
</I>&gt;<i> shows up in the file manager as &quot;CDROM&quot;.  I'm assuming it does this
</I>&gt;<i> because it's a hybrid and the CDROM label is the result of OS seeing
</I>&gt;<i> this partition as an ISO.
</I>
yes and if label means volid you can check with isoinfo if the volid
is set to CDROM. If so this can be changed by the volid=&quot;...&quot; attribute
in your &lt;type&gt; section of the config.xml

&gt;<i> I was going to try reversing the partition order...but I'm sure you
</I>&gt;<i> guys thought of that.  I assume if I did that, the image wouldn't boot
</I>&gt;<i> from it?
</I>
yes the boot code assumes partition 1 is the root device

Did you ever test to have a USB with a partition table where the
first partition is a fat partition and the second one is a linux
partition. Can Windows cope with that or does it complain too ?

If that works and you are switching to the usb image type there
are still patches to kiwi required:

1) change the usb deployment code to create a data partition
   first and the OS parts after it. That's in KIWIBoot.pm

2) change the usb boot code to allow shifting the OS partitions
   after the data partition. That's in usbboot/suse-linuxrc

This can be done quick and dirty but a clean solution would
take more time. I also think Robert Schweikert had the plan
to implement this in kiwi some time ago

So I'm afraid maybe you should roam and search other live
distro's or builder which are more Windows friendly. I would
be very interested how they solve that problem. 

Thanks for your feedback and sorry if you think it
was a waste of time. Hope you will find a solution which
works for you

Regards,
Marcus
