Hi Marcus

&quot;/boot or /lvmboot is a bad location for this because those
directories are created on first boot of the OS. Having that said
you can't place files in root/boot/... of your overlay tree in
your image description because they will not show up.

To my knowledge KDE4 .desktop files are stored in the users
home directory. So copy your .desktop file into the home directory
of the desired user in the overlay tree:

  cd &lt;image-description&gt;
  cd root
  mkdir -p /home/&lt;user-name&gt;/.local/share/applications/
  cp &lt;icon-name&gt;.desktop /home/&lt;user-name&gt;/.local/share/applications/&quot;

Ok actually I'm using LXDE/Openbox for this project but no matter I
can find what talking about.
I did already make the .desktop file..but to what does this .desktop
file actually point too that will be there after the first boot?
I noticed after the first boot that the USB fat partition mounts in
/media.  Actually with this particular USB drive the path is
/media/910E-c98C.   Ok so I can't point the .desktop file at that
specific path because the &quot;910E-c98C&quot; part of the path will
change/vary with different USB drives...so what can I point this
.desktop file at that will be consistent with any USB drive?   I
didn't just want to point it at /media because in the media location
(which is the only location that it appears that the fat partition is
accessible from) there is a &quot;boot&quot; directory along with a file
&quot;ldlinux.sy&quot;.  I really would hope to avoid have the end user being
placed here.   I was hoping to create the &quot;Storage&quot; folder on the fat
partition and have the .desktop file point at it.

Also after the second boot the file manager now shows the mounted fat
partition as &quot;325 MB Filesystem&quot;.  Is this label for this editable?
Is this a Kiwi changeable thing?

The last question is what would be the behavior if i changed kiwi's
element &quot;ramonly=&quot;true&quot;&quot; to &quot;false&quot;?
