<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Perhaps a compatibility matrix for kiwi is needed. Various OS releases
</I>&gt;<i> by kiwi recipe. Fill in what works out-of-the-box, and what needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> tweaked to make it work.
</I>
yes this is pretty hard to setup. there is the &quot;build system version&quot;
vs &quot;the image system version&quot; and then there are also different versions
of tools like clicfs, squashfs and more, combined with bugs sometimes
fixed in update repos and sometimes not.

Kiwi supports many combinations (maybe too much) and kiwi itself
also has bugs. So it's really hard. So far I can only say it's
a good approach to:

 * use the same version for the building system and the image system,
   that sorts out many incompatibilities

 * next it's good to always add the update repo for the distribution
   because that sorts out many bugs found after the release

Would that have helped you... no because you ran into a kernel
issue which was only fixed in a newer kernel branch but not as
an update to an older one :(

You should always have in mind that I can only influence the
stability to a certain degree. I cannot make the kernel developer
to fix a bug in an old kernel and I also can't push others to
fix their code ;) I certainly encourage all of them to fix
as much as they can but it's all about cooperation and willingness.

In SuSE Studio we do exactly that. We support a subset of image
types for one version (11.4) and not more. For our enterprise
products we specify a subset of features which has to work.
In none of them we mention support for 

   &quot;PXE images with root over AoE + clicfs&quot;

This is one of the reasony why things might break and are not
tested well enough. The people using kiwi directly do all
sorts of things, which is great :) but also wide opens the
door for problems in all areas of the distribution and kiwi
itself.

That's why I appreciate your help, feedback and reports.

I hope despite the fact that you stumbled over so many
bad problems you still keep on trying it the kiwi way

Thanks

Regards,
Marcus
