Hey Marcus,

&gt;<i> What you are saying is that if you turn off your notebook, plugg off
</I>&gt;<i> the USB stick, put it in your desktop machine , switch on your desktop
</I>&gt;<i> machine and boot from the stick, then you can't see the fat partition ?

</I>&gt;<i> before has been stored. So I'm still confused
</I>
Exactly.  I can't see the fat partition in using the desktop computer.
 The fat partition is there...but I must manually mount it!  I pulled
up the Yast Partitioner with the OS running on the Desktop and none of
partitions are set for &quot;mount partition&quot; where on the notebook
computer it has the &quot;mount partition&quot; enabled and the mount point is
&quot;/media/d9b9-e7bd&quot;  How the heck can it automount on one machine and
not on the other?   Maybe this is a good thing.  The goal here is to
have a &quot;storage&quot; partition mount for direct access to this folder...so
what is causing this fat partition (and the existing hard drives
partitions) to auto mount when used int he latptop.  Some config file
must be saying &quot;find the fat partition and mout it 'here'&quot;.   Actually
now that I think of it ONLY the fat partition mounts on the notebook
computer.  The existing hard drive partitions simply show up in the
file manager but don't mount until you access them.

Stressful stuff. :(
Marcus thanks for continuing to answer these questions and trying to
address the problems.  I know this is getting old.  This inconsistent
behavior is concerning to me because it must work the same on all
machines otherwise what's the point.

One more thing that I notice after I started using the OEM image
compared to the ISO image is when booting now the OEM image will
always boot in verbose mode (with the bootsplash image behind) where
as with the ISO boot it would show the progress bootsplash screen.
Any idea what's up with that?
