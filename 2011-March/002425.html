<PRE>Hi Chris,

&gt;<i> First off I should say that I didn't mean any disrespect about my
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;waste of time&quot; statement.
</I>
:<i>) no worries, it wasn't understood like that
</I>
&gt;<i> Anyway here is what I've tried so far.
</I>&gt;<i> As a test I took the drive and using the Windows format to make a fat
</I>&gt;<i> partition. Windows of course sees it just fine.  Linux does also.
</I>&gt;<i> I then started Yast (parted) partitioning software and removed all
</I>&gt;<i> partitions on this 1gb drive. The drive itself is sdf.  I made sdf1 be
</I>&gt;<i> the Fat partition and sdf2 to be the linux partion.  I &quot;dd&quot; the iso to
</I>&gt;<i> the sdf2.  I tried booting from it...no go.  I stuck it in a Win
</I>&gt;<i> machine.  The fat partition was available.  I then reversed the
</I>&gt;<i> partitions.  So sdf1 was the iso and sdf2 was the fat partition.  It
</I>&gt;<i> boots fine but when I put it in a Win machine it wants to format the
</I>&gt;<i> drive!!  I'm going to SNAP!
</I>&gt;<i> I tried also to change the hex digit in the string on the drive
</I>&gt;<i> itself...no go.  This has to be done in Windows with some software
</I>&gt;<i> that Matt pointed out.
</I>&gt;<i> I also tried changing the driver in Windows for this USB drive.  This
</I>&gt;<i> didn't work either however I need to try it again as I think I missed
</I>&gt;<i> a critical step.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So it appears that you can't boot off a USB drive it the boot sector
</I>&gt;<i> is anything but partition 1 and Windows won't see the USB drive if
</I>&gt;<i> it's anything but partition 1!!  Honestly modifying the USB to be a
</I>&gt;<i> internal drive is an option but so far as I expected nothing is
</I>&gt;<i> working.  Windows is pretty stupid when It comes to removable media
</I>&gt;<i> that's for sure.
</I>
This is basically what other people found out too :(
I think we should make kiwi's usbboot code more windows friendly
I opened an enhancement bug report for this one including
your feedback:

  <A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=677246">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=677246</A>

&gt;<i> Question.  When you look at a usb drive on the partition software it
</I>&gt;<i> would show up as sdf.  Ok so sdf is the drive itself it seems.
</I>
yes

&gt;<i> I noticed that I can either create another partition (sdf1) for the
</I>&gt;<i> bootable linux iso..or i can dump it on sdf.  What is the difference?
</I>
the bootable linux iso contains a drive layout. Which means it also
includes the partition table. Therefore you should dump the iso
always on /dev/sdf and not on a partition /dev/sdf1

&gt;<i> Then should the fat partition go on sdf1 (if the os bootable iso is on
</I>&gt;<i> sdf) or should it go on sdf2?
</I>
the fat data partititon must be on /dev/sdf1 and the linux system
on /dev/sdf2. But all that must be part of the iso itself because
it embeds that partition table

This is also the reason why it's in this case better to let kiwi
deploy the partition table (including the fat data partition) and
the system itself by the kiwi --bootstick method.

I was thinking on a new attribute in config.xml like:

   winspace=&quot;200M&quot;  or winspace=&quot;auto&quot;

or something which then creates some space as the first partition
as fat filesystem at the right place on the stick to make
Windows happy

Marcus
