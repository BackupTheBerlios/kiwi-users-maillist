<PRE>Hi Wolfgang,

&gt;<i> It looks to me that everything is related to OpenSuse 10.3. Is kiwi
</I>&gt;<i> already released?
</I>
Hmm, don't understand that question. openSUSE 10.3 will be the first
openSUSE version with kiwi onboard, but it has been built for other
suse versions as well and is available on the openSUSE buildservice

&gt;<i> Does the Hardware of the client matter or can I use any hardware as
</I>&gt;<i> client? And if yes, where does the hardware dependent part begin?
</I>
The kiwi boot images (initrd) in your case the netboot boot image
contains by default all required drivers of the kernel according
to the distribution and architecture you use. So if the standard
kernel of this distribution supports your hardware it is supported
by kiwi as well. Right now we support only x86 and x86_64
architectures with kiwi but that is supposed to be enhanced in
the future (this requires more people to work on it)

&gt;<i> To use an autoyast.xml file. What has to go in there? I've got a working
</I>&gt;<i> autoyast file, which works fine with an network installation. I've
</I>&gt;<i> copied this into the config directory. The kiwi client starts yast after
</I>&gt;<i> booting up but the contest of this file doesn't seem to be read or
</I>&gt;<i> executed. Do I have to drop some sections out of this file I am thinking
</I>&gt;<i> especially about the section software and partitioning.
</I>
If you put the autoyast xml file as &quot;config-yast.xml&quot; into your
image description yast will start automatically, of course only
if yast is part of your image. I think you got so far already. The
problem with the software depends on the fact that kiwi did not
use the yast packagemanager if you don't specify it in config.xml
(&lt;packagemanager&gt;zypper&lt;/packagemanager&gt;) As consequence there is
no service for yast defined. In order to do that you need to add
a yast(zypper) service in your image description config.sh script

For example something like this could work:

	rm -rf /var/cache/zypp/raw/*
	zypper addrepo <A HREF="http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/10.3/repo/oss/">http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/10.3/repo/oss/</A> 10.3
	zypper addrepo <A HREF="http://download.opensuse.org/update/10.3/">http://download.opensuse.org/update/10.3/</A> 10.3-update
 
This will allow yast to install and update packages if network is available
after booting the image

&gt;<i> I've put a list of packages followed by a list of patterns into the
</I>&gt;<i> config.xml file. Which I have taken over from the autoyast file. The
</I>&gt;<i> kiwi --prepare complains about a missing pattern (sw_management). I've
</I>&gt;<i> already checked it on my repository and it is there. All other patterns
</I>&gt;<i> are read. Is there a debug option for the kiwi --prepare or --create.
</I>&gt;<i> The output is not very detailed and knowing what kiwi is actually doing
</I>&gt;<i> would probably help a lot with this.
</I>
The patterns itself sometimes has bugs and this is one of them. The pattern
sw_management has been renamed to sw_management-10.3 but the reference may
still be outdated so I assume this do disappear soon.

You are right with the output, it should talk a bit more in case
of an error here.

Regards,
Marcus
