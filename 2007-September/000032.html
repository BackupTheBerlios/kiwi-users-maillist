<PRE>Hello List,
 
a few days ago I started to work my way through the kiwi.... I am using
an 'NFS mounted root system' and/or 'deploying via network using the pxe
protocol' in a OpenSuse 10.2 environment. The final decision is still
open. 
I am finally able to boot up the client, there are still some problems
and lots of questions...
 
Here are some of them:
 
It looks to me that everything is related to OpenSuse 10.3. Is kiwi
already released?
 
Does the Hardware of the client matter or can I use any hardware as
client? And if yes, where does the hardware dependent part begin?
 
To use an autoyast.xml file. What has to go in there? I've got a working
autoyast file, which works fine with an network installation. I've
copied this into the config directory. The kiwi client starts yast after
booting up but the contest of this file doesn't seem to be read or
executed. Do I have to drop some sections out of this file I am thinking
especially about the section software and partitioning. 
 
I've put a list of packages followed by a list of patterns into the
config.xml file. Which I have taken over from the autoyast file. The
kiwi --prepare complains about a missing pattern (sw_management). I've
already checked it on my repository and it is there. All other patterns
are read. Is there a debug option for the kiwi --prepare or --create.
The output is not very detailed and knowing what kiwi is actually doing
would probably help a lot with this.
 
Ok, I think that's enough for Friday afternoon. 
Thanks 
Wolfgang
