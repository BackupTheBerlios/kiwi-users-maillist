<PRE>Hi Mitch,

&gt;<i> 1.  I was considering using isoinstboot as a re-spin installer method
</I>&gt;<i> from a bootCD to an empty box.  What would be the preferred method now
</I>&gt;<i> that isoinstboot is removed?  Oemboot?
</I>
yes, my suggestion would be to create a virtual disk image using
the following type specification:

	&lt;type filesystem=&quot;ext3&quot; boot=&quot;oemboot/suse-...&quot;&gt;vmx&lt;/type&gt;

Once the image has been created the installation is a simple
dd if=/the/image of=/dev/diskdevice. After that the disk has a bootloader
and an initial oemboot initrd which adapts the installation to the
real disk geometry on first boot.

But there are problems:
-----------------------
1) right now the oemboot boot image description exists only for
   suse-SLED10-SP1 and suse-SLED10-SP1-smp. If you need it for another
   suse distribution I need to create a description first. I will do
   that if you tell me for what distro you need it. I assume you
   need it for 10.3 ;)

2) The installation process formerly done by isoinstboot doesn't
   exist anymore because the design of isoinstboot was outdated and
   non functional anymore. So we need to implement the task of
   installation (the dd in principal) in either a new bootimage
   description for kiwi or we implement it as enhancement of
   oemboot.

Feel free to open an enhancement bug report for this one
I will implement as fast as I can.

&gt;<i> 2.  I'm currently using an opensuse 10.3 beta 1 box as my kiwi build
</I>&gt;<i> machine, having tried a 10.2 with not much luck.  Is Kiwi intended as a
</I>&gt;<i> 10.3+ tool?
</I>
It should work on 10.1 + (SLE) and 10.2 as well

&gt;<i> 3.  Is openSUSE itself moving to Kiwi as a build tool?  I guess what i
</I>&gt;<i> mean is, is kiwi going to be a long term stable project?
</I>
definitely yes. Novell/SuSE doesn't have an image builder and kiwi
should be the image builder used for the future. I already checked in
kiwi to be part of openSUSE 10.3. This includes the responsibility
of maintenance and I want to have it on SLE11 as well. The SLEPOS
product (SUSE Linux Enterprise Point Of Sale) will use kiwi as image
builder for the next version.

Regards,
Marcus
