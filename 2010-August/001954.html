<PRE>==================================================
Changes Report kiwi v4.55 2010-08-01 - 2010-08-06
--------------------------------------------------
most important changes for last weeks release...

GIT:  update documentation, patch by Thomas Schraitle
 
  Thanks Thomas

GIT:  EC2: changed the way how ec2 images are created. We now bundle
      the ami from a raw disk Xen image using the ec2 kernel. Along
      with this change the xenboot boot image became obsolete and was
      removed in a previous commit. Support for Xen is now only availabe
      via disk image and Xen must support PVgrub in order to boot it

  For those of you who used xen guests in the form

  &lt;type image=&quot;xen&quot; 
        filesystem=&quot;...&quot; boot=&quot;xenboot/suse-...&quot;&gt;

  change that to:

  &lt;type image=&quot;vmx&quot;
        filesystem=&quot;...&quot; boot=&quot;vmxboot/suse-...&quot;
        bootprofile=&quot;xen&quot; bootkernel=&quot;xenk&quot;&gt;

  I also changed the suse-xen-guest example and docs from the kiwi-doc
  packages appropriately. You can run the EC2 commands directly on
  the .raw file created by kiwi, or let kiwi do it if you have set
  &lt;type .... format=&quot;ec2&quot;&gt;

GIT:  fixed respect write protection for Live medium (SD-card)
      bnc#623038

  On SD cards we didn't care for the write protection. With this
  patch no data is written if the write protection is set to on

GIT:  don't check the return value of the e2fsck call. If the
      filesystem check was forced for example by a wrong system
      clock the check runs successfully but the return value is
      not zero.

  If you are deploying an image on a system which has a wrong
  hardware clock setup or your image creation time is older than
  the filesystem check count the filesystem check is forced. But
  even though the check ends successfully the return code is
  not &quot;0&quot; in that case. That's the reason why it's ignored in
  this situation

GIT   fixed license display problem when no localized license files
      exist but a license.txt file does

  Thanks to Robert for fixing this

GIT   if a fixed xml size was set for a filesystem image we use if
      even if kiwi's calculation says it's too small. This allows users
      to create the image with less or no free space but also could
      cause the image to fail because of no space left on device.
      We don't use the fixed xml size if it's too small for a virtual
      disk based image though because this could cause the image to
      be created successfully but then failed on boot which is a bad
      user experience (bnc #627031)

  When creating a filesystem image like this

    &lt;type image=&quot;ext3&quot;&gt;
       &lt;size unit=&quot;M&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/size&gt;
    &lt;/type&gt;

  the &lt;size&gt; setup won't be changed by kiwi's thinking of the
  minimum size. This was requested by the Novell POS people

GIT   added entire usb stack to initrd for SLE11 oemboot (bnc #627439)

  When booting an OEM install media from USB connected drive it
  fails because the drivers were missing

Regards
Marcus
