<PRE>Marcus,

It's been a while since you responded to this thread and I'm just getting 
a chance to respond.

I'd like to investigate using a &quot;Live&quot; kiwi build for my complex 
installation and I would like your opinion.   Here is why I need so my 
&quot;function&quot; in my initrd:

1.  I am using the kiwi built installation to install an openSuse 11.1 on 
a full &quot;rack&quot; of machines in manufacturing.  The machines are straight out 
of the PC factory and have no configuration.  The installation needs to be 
completely automated.  The initially loaded machine (lets call it the 
&quot;Head Node&quot;) is installed first and then is the master for loading all the 
rest of the machines in the system.  The Head Node contains a megaraid-sas 
driven hard disk card that must be configured (automatically) before the 
machine can boot from the hard disk.  The tool to do this requires some 
special libraries be available.

Rather than having so much in the initial booted initrd, would it be more 
straight forward to have the first initrd load a &quot;bigger&quot; squashfs 
filesystem (built by kiwi) into memory switch the kernel over to that, and 
run all my &quot;special&quot; code from that bigger filesystem?  I would need a 
couple of suggestions on how to configure this build and then an 
additional build that would be the &quot;real&quot;, hard disk based Linux that the 
&quot;bigger&quot; filesystem would load onto the hard disk.

2.  The Linux on the Head Node sets up a TFTP, DHCP, and NFS server to 
allow all the rest of the machines in the rack (call these the &quot;Remote 
Nodes&quot;) to PXE (network) boot from the head node.  The difficulty here is 
that the Head Node sets up each of the Remote Nodes to initially boot from 
the network, but each of the remote nodes must have the capability to 
change there own boot order back to the hard disk before booting from the 
hard disk.  This causes another reason to have a large initial initrd OR a 
&quot;bigger&quot; filesystem that is loaded into memory to do the &quot;heavy lifting&quot;.

Please get back to me when you can.

Regards,

J.

Re: [Kiwi-users] Additional packages needed in OEM (DVD) boot image






Hi J,

&gt;<i> We run our own install script  in the boot image of our OEM build,  We 
</I>&gt;<i> need to run a binary executable that requires libstdc++.so.6 while 
</I>running 
&gt;<i> in the boot image. 
</I>
Uhm, *urgl* why do you want to that in the boot image ?

&gt;<i> (i.e. our of the DVD's initrd )  I attempted to 
</I>&gt;<i> request that the libstdc++43 package be included in the boot image with 
</I>&gt;<i> the following line in the config.xml:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;package name=&quot;libstdc++43&quot; bootinclude=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
</I>
Well the initrd is kept as small as possible therefore all not directly
linked libraries are ripped out. A small subset of dl loaded libraries
are excluded from that process though.

&gt;<i> The library was not included in the boot image initrd.  Is there an 
</I>&gt;<i> architected way to include extra simple software packages in the boot 
</I>&gt;<i> image initrd?  (The bootinclude=&quot;true&quot; for the megaraid_sas driver 
</I>package 
&gt;<i> worked great!)
</I>
bootincluding of drivers, configurations and friends was the intention
behind the feature. Installing additional software into the bootimage by
a bootinclude has always the same problem that the code which makes the
initrd small will rip out all the stuff which is not required to the
job this initrd code was made for.

Let me suggest another way:

1) install the software in your system image without bootinclude !

2) decide whether the code you want to run really needs to run
   inside the initrd or not:

   a) Assuming it doesn't have to run in the initrd
   =================================================

   - write a runlevel script which calls your software and place the
     script in etc/init.d/ in your root/ overlay files tree of the
     system image description
 
   - activate the service to run on boot by adding the following
     in your config.sh script of the system image description

     suseInsertService name

   b) Assuming it has to run in the initrd for whatever reason
   ============================================================

   - write a script called 'preCallInit.sh' which calls your software
   - place that script in a tarball so that it is listed with the
     following path and name

     /kiwi-hooks/preCallInit.sh

   - assuming the tarballs name is preCallInit.tgz then put that
     file in your system image description directory at the same
     level were your config.xml lives

   - add the following line in your system image config.xml:

     &lt;archive name=&quot;preCallInit.tgz&quot; bootinclude=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
 
     This will install the script in the initrd too and it
     will not be removed as it could happen with add-on libs
     The preCallInit hook runs inside the initrd exactly before
     calling the system init prozess. At that stage the root
     mount point has already moved into the system image which
     means you can access all software installed in the system
     image and that also includes your installer or whatever you
     would like to call

I hope that solves your problem. Any other place in the initrd
would require a code change imho and that also means you need to
maintain the code yourself ;)

Regards,
Marcus
