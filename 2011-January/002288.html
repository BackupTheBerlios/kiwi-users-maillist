<PRE>Hi Kiwi Devs &amp; Users,

As I don't have an Novell account and figured out a strange bug and got the 
advice to report it here I took some time to write this mail. 

First of all I tried kiwi many times here on my pc with different openSUSE 
versions (from 11.1 to 11.4) and never had a success really in booting it 
successfully with my U3 USB stick. As I found some time now to investigate the 
problem a little further I grabbed a openSUSE 11.4 M6 Hybrid LiveISO (KDE4 
variant) and tried it once again. As expected it didn't boot and gave me the 
&quot;Couldn't find Live image configuration file&quot; error. 
Btw. I build the live usb stick just like suggested with dd'ing the iso onto 
the usb stick and as it didn't boot I even uses dd_rescue which does the same 
thing like dd I guess. It resulted in the same error. 
So I activated the 'kiwidebug=1' bootoption to take a look in the init/linuxrc 
and include file (btw. a simple texteditor like vi might be handy for adding in 
the initrd for debugging purposes). I found the CDMount function in init which 
pointed me to take a look into the include file which then pointed me to the 
CDDevice function in the same file. 
First of all I tried echo'ing out the devices which where found with CDDevice 
(line 2924 where the 'search for CD/DVD devices' part starts) because I 
guessed the script detected only the CD part of the U3 stick and not the usb 
drive itself somehow. (and no I don't have a cd/dvd drive, because its a 
netbook) And well it was exactly what I expected to see it mounted 12 times 
/dev/sr0 which is the cd part of the U3 stick and searched for the isoclient 
live configuration file which is obviously not on the U3s cd part. 
So I took a look at the CDDevice function in the include file and to my 
surprise I found that 'hwinfo --cdrom' is used to get the device name (i.e. 
/dev/sr0). So I changed that to '$h --block ...' and rebuild initrd replaced 
the one on the stick with my patched one and what can I say it boots just fine 
now without any error. (I attached a patch file which highlights the changes 
for the devs) 
The interesting and useful side effect of adding this patch was the possibility 
to create  openSUSE LiveUSB Sticks with third party apps like unetbootin. The 
only thing I needed to replace was the initrd. 
I think it is a very useful feature, because I don't understand why only cd 
devices are searched for the isoclient config file. 
It might be also better as the current usb boot option (which I only saw in 
the code and didn't test out though) which somehow just like I understand it 
will check if there is space on the usb stick and will automatically create a 
cow (copy on write / overlay / persistent) image and uses it. Using this slows 
down the experience of the live usb user as writing to some common usb sticks 
is slow and especially its a somehow pain in the ass for every netbook user 
who just only wants to test out if openSUSE runs on his netbook and when it 
does install it. 

So I appreciate comments &amp; feedback on this topic and hopefully I am not 
bothering the community with some already solved problem :)
