<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> 1.  I am using the kiwi built installation to install an openSuse 11.1 on 
</I>&gt;<i> a full &quot;rack&quot; of machines in manufacturing.  The machines are straight out 
</I>&gt;<i> of the PC factory and have no configuration.  The installation needs to be 
</I>&gt;<i> completely automated.  The initially loaded machine (lets call it the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Head Node&quot;) is installed first and then is the master for loading all the 
</I>&gt;<i> rest of the machines in the system.  The Head Node contains a megaraid-sas 
</I>&gt;<i> driven hard disk card that must be configured (automatically) before the 
</I>&gt;<i> machine can boot from the hard disk.  The tool to do this requires some 
</I>&gt;<i> special libraries be available.
</I>
Given that you have setup the raid in the megaraid bios you need
the megaraid storage manager operating and functional inside the
initrd in order to access the device. I agree a couple of tools
and libraries as well as some code in the initrd to setup the
devices is required. But I wouldn't vote for an extra system packed
into a squashfs to handle this. I would enlarge the initrd to
support it. I think with todays RAM capabilities you shouldn't 
have problems with this extra requirement. Booting from a megaraid
device might have another problem though, because I don't know
if the system mkinitrd tool is able reboot that system. This means
it might happen that your custom initrd has to serve for the
initial and any subsequent boot of the system if mkinitrd
doesn't support it.

If you plan to implement that I suggest to create some functions
for handling the megaraid storage manager and hook into the
probeDevices() function to make the devices available. ALl that
in KIWILinuxRC.sh. I think if the storage devices are present
the rest of the deployment code doesn't need a change

&gt;<i> 2.  The Linux on the Head Node sets up a TFTP, DHCP, and NFS server to 
</I>&gt;<i> allow all the rest of the machines in the rack (call these the &quot;Remote 
</I>&gt;<i> Nodes&quot;) to PXE (network) boot from the head node.
</I>
got that

&gt;<i>  The difficulty here is 
</I>&gt;<i> that the Head Node sets up each of the Remote Nodes to initially boot from 
</I>&gt;<i> the network,
</I>
How can the head node influence the boot behavior of the other nodes
imho the bios of each node determines the boot order

&gt;<i> but each of the remote nodes must have the capability to 
</I>&gt;<i> change there own boot order back to the hard disk before booting from the 
</I>&gt;<i> hard disk. 
</I>
wouldn't this require that the OS have access to the bios and modify
the boot order from there. I'm not aware of a tool which can do
that. But I remember IBM wrote a posbios tool for their own bios so
you can control some parts of the bios from within the os. But I
think it's not a common task

&gt;<i> This causes another reason to have a large initial initrd OR a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;bigger&quot; filesystem that is loaded into memory to do the &quot;heavy lifting&quot;.
</I>
I don't understand the connection between the initrd and the
ability to modify the bios boot order.

Just a side note:

I recently added the ability to temporary mount and run the 
&quot;about to become installed&quot; system image in kiwi. It works using
a device mapper snapshot map which allows all the write actions
to go into a tempoary cow file. That way you can put all the big
apps like X a windowmanager and everything else as part of your
system image without increasing the initrd. I use that in kiwi
to allow the graphical setup of the partition table with gparted
while in the partition based installation mode. If you are
interested in that take a look at the function

   createSnapshotMap()  

in KIWILinuxRC.sh and the code actually using it in

   oemboot/suse-dump

I think that goes into the direction you are thinking about.
But again for the megaraid-sas support I would add everything
into the initrd directly. I don't think it's that big
...could be wrong of course

Regards,
Marcus
