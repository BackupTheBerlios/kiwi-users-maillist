I have 2 split images which were based on the same xml definition. One of them use ext3 for both read-only and read-write parts and the other one uses squashfs for the read-only part. I want to compare performance on both situations.

Size for the ext3-only image:

. cb-live-stick.i686-0.2.0 - 3.6GB
. cb-live-stick-read-write.i686-0.2.1 - 92MB

Size for the squashfs + ext3 image:

. cb-live-stick.i686-0.2.1 - 1.2GB
. cb-live-stick-read-write.i686-0.2.1 - 92 MB

The primary stick I'm using is 8GB. I tried a 4 GB one only for testing, as I thought the 8GB one could be damaged.

I'm sure the stick wasn't mounted before calling 'kiwi --bootstick'. I know that because I tried it several times, with the stick mounted and with it not mounted.

&gt;<i> What kiwi does is it calls fdisk and after that it checks the size of
</I>&gt;<i> the created partitions. If the size is ok for the image it puts it on
</I>&gt;<i> the stick if not it increases the partition size and restarts fdisk
</I>&gt;<i> again. kiwi does that because of the alignment done by fdisk. I have
</I>&gt;<i> also implemented support for parted but didn't test it hard enough.
</I>
Now I got it. I took a look at KIWIBoot.pm and I couldn't figure out why that loop was needed. 

Btw, it's also clear that the issue isn't related to kiwi upgrade, but to some change I made to the image definition. As I also upgraded kiwi, I thought it was related.

&gt;<i> If you like you can give it a try with the option:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    --partitioner parted
</I>
I'll try it, as it shouldn't hurt (I hope).

cheers,
