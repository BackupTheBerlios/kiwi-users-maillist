Agreed, I don't think it needs to be a required feature.

</I>I'll look into that, not heard of it as of yet.
&gt;<i> Sounds great. Concerning the configuration you only should keep the
</I>&gt;<i> system of key=value as I don't want to break the simple shell sourcing
</I>&gt;<i> code inside the initrd. So I think it's not required to change currently
</I>&gt;<i> existing keys but the implementation will introduce a few new keys
</I>&gt;<i> for the mapping table which is not a problem at all imho. As long as
</I>&gt;<i> we didn't release it outside we are also free to change key names and
</I>&gt;<i> such
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Agreed, I'm leaning towards putting the key=value entry in the 
config.&lt;MAC&gt; and config.&lt;group_name&gt; files, as an optional entry. I had 
thought about putting it in the group.config but then it would restrict 
it to only groups, and that seems like half a feature to me :&gt;

&gt;<i> Your last two enhancements are already in as you might have seen.
</I>&gt;<i> So you have full support from my side to get that change in too :)
</I>&gt;<i> Concerning the project I have to keep an eye on not breaking existing
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure and interfaces but I'm sure you are aware of that
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your effort
</I>
Aye, and welcome :&gt;
