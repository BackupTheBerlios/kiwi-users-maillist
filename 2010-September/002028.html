<PRE>  Hi Everyone,

After reviewing the work I did to the initial grouping code that took 
into account cases where the IP addresses may not be sequential, or the 
vendors are different. I have come up with a case where I think some 
additional work may need to be done to incorporate additional 
enhancements. As such, I'm posting here to start a discussion to get 
input from the main KIWI developer. I should be able to help incorporate 
these ideas into the group code, and or other areas that might be able 
to make use of it.

The working case in question requires that a set of mixed vendor 
hardware function as a single group. This group requires these machines 
to differ due to available hardware requirements, such as the following 
(this is an arbitrary example, but is conceivable as a valid configuration):

stations 1-5 require 2 serial ports, 1 non-touch screen with 1024x768x24 
resolution, 1 PS/2 mouse, and 1 keyboard, 1 printer
stations 6-15 require 4 serial ports, 1 touch screen with 800x600x16 
resolution, no mouse and no keyboard
stations 16-35 require 6 serial ports, 1 touch screen with 1280x1024x24 
bit resolution, no mouse, no keyboard, but specific serial ports have to 
be assigned to certain hardware.

For what ever reason, stations 1-5 are from one vendor, 6-15 from a 
second, and 16-35 from a third. However, the storage configuration is 
the same with a common CF card size used across the board. In addition, 
there are 15 groups configured exactly the same, but all are assigned to 
boot off the same DHCP/PXE server. The 15 groups also boot from the same 
source image, seeing as I see no need to customize multiple images with 
simple alternative configuration files could be used. They are, however, 
different in that they are assigned different source servers, or something.

So, with the current group configuration I would create 45 group 
entries, and 45 group files in addition to all the supporting 
application configuration files. There would be quite a lot of 
duplication involved as 3 group files would be pointing to the same 
source server or other application, and that would be repeated 15 times 
for the various source servers, etc.

What I am proposing is to add some form of &quot;hardware inheritance&quot; 
grouping that could help simplify things immensely. With hardware 
inheritance we  would have to only create 15 group files, 3 hardware 
&quot;vendor&quot; files, and the application specific configuration files. 
Continuing our example, here would be an optimized set of configuration 
files for a single group:

config.group:

KIWI_GROUP=&quot;group1, group2, group3, ... group15&quot;

group1_KIWI_MAC_LIST=&quot;xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:x1, xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:x2, 
xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:x3, ..., xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:35&quot;
...

The config.group1 file would contain:

KIWI_INITRD=/boot/initrd
KIWI_KERNEL=/boot/linux
DISK=/dev/sda
PART=5;S;x,769;L;/,x;L;x,
IMAGE=/dev/sda2;test_group1-11.3-pxe-client.i686;0.0.1;192.168.xxx.xxx;4096
UNIONFS_CONFIG=/dev/sda3,/dev/sda2,clicfs
CONF=prefs.js;/home/kioskuser/.mozilla/firefox/mjc8q85s.default;192.168.xxx.xxx;4096
HARDWARE_MAP=&quot;vendor1, vendor2, vendor3&quot;
vendor1_HARDWARE_MAP=&quot;xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:x1, xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:x2, ..., 
xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:x5&quot;
vendor2_HARDWARE_MAP=&quot;xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:x6, xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:x7, ..., 
xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:15&quot;
vendor3_HARDWARE_MAP=&quot;xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:16, xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:17, ..., 
xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:35&quot;

This way, we could point KIWI to load up &quot;KIWI/hardware_map.vendor1&quot; or 
even put it as part of the vendor map itself, but allow the user to link 
hardware MAC addresses to the assigned mapping.

Inside the hardware_map.vendor1 file would reside an additional set of 
parameters:

CONF=serial.vendor1;/etc/sysconfig/custom_serial_config;192.168.xxx.xxx;4096, 
etc...

inside hardware_map.vendor2 would be:

CONF=serial.vendor2;/etc/sysconfig/custom_serial_config;192.168.xxx.xxx;4096, 
etc...

etc.

This should reduce the number of files that require additional 
management, and enable these hardware_map.vendorx files to be used 
across all 15 groups, seeing as the hardware was placed as such.

I think if we could add this ability to the grouping component, we could 
address pretty much all cases that might come up in relation to terminal 
deployment, and be able to provide more configuration flexibility.

Because this would add variables to the config.&lt;group_name&gt; files, I 
figured it would be best to talk it through first before, as essentially 
each machine would be assigned to two groups, one to link it to what 
ever application it is going to be utilizing, and one to ensure the 
hardware is configured the way it is needed. It might also be useful to 
non-PXE specific areas.

I'm not sold on the HARDWARE_MAP elements being added to the 
config.&lt;group_name&gt; file, and it may be more appropriate in the 
config.group file, maybe by simply adding 3 additional groups at the end 
of the group list or an additional_groups parameter or something that 
would be searched in addition to the initial group itself.

Definitely want some thoughts before moving forward with it.
