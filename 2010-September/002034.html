<PRE>Hi,

&gt;&gt;<i> If I understand you correctly this is kind of a stacked configuration.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So the main entrance is the MAC based mapping from a group followed by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a vendor specific add-on. If this is correct I really like the idea.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, correct, the first stack would allow for &quot;common&quot; application 
</I>&gt;<i> functionality to be configured, as well as the storage devices, thus far I 
</I>&gt;<i> can't think of a way to use mixed storage configurations with out breaking 
</I>&gt;<i> them out into another group. The second stack would link hardware specific 
</I>&gt;<i> components outside of the initial application configuration, for vendor 
</I>&gt;<i> specific components that are &quot;shipped&quot; with the hardware. So essentially 
</I>&gt;<i> the stack would:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stage/Stack 1
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Boot into the initrd, as it currently does.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Load the image, and other elements via the config.&lt;MAC&gt; or 
</I>&gt;<i> config.&lt;group_name&gt; files, depending on if the systems is linked to a group 
</I>&gt;<i> or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At this point Stage/Stack 2 kicks in (if the system admin has decided to 
</I>&gt;<i> use/configure it):
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Check for hardware specific mapping files
</I>&gt;<i> 4. If found, load the configurations into the image.
</I>
Sounds great !

&gt;<i> Then it continues to boot the kernel as it currently does.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How do you plan to specify the vendor ? Do you want to use a unique
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> machine id ? I mean somehow we need to check which vendor map fits
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the machine we are currently on.
</I>&gt;<i> I had not fully worked out this idea, so I was figuring the initial version 
</I>&gt;<i> would be configured by the system admins themselves, with kiwi based 
</I>&gt;<i> variables defined either in the config.group, or 
</I>&gt;<i> config.&lt;MAC&gt;/config.&lt;group_name&gt; files. As we got feed back in relation to 
</I>&gt;<i> it, we could slowly work in some form of automated methodology to map the 
</I>&gt;<i> hardware to a known list, or something. This would require research into 
</I>&gt;<i> the vendors and hardware suppliers to create that mapping file, however, 
</I>&gt;<i> and would need community involvement for sure. The automated method could 
</I>&gt;<i> not take into account hardware that had additional add-ons, such as PCI 
</I>&gt;<i> based serial cards or additional network interfaces, as that would have 
</I>&gt;<i> been a vendor -&gt; customer agreement, ontop of the base hardware 
</I>&gt;<i> configuration. Unless we created an &quot;add-ons&quot; map, that would be optionally 
</I>&gt;<i> activated as needed, but again we'd need the base code components there 
</I>&gt;<i> before we even considered that.
</I>
I'm fine with that as long as it's not _required_ to have a vendor specific
map in place we also have time to work out the code without breaking
the existing solution.

- Do you know about the dmidecode program ? it gives you some information
  about the BIOS thus including some kind of vendor informations which
  can serve to identify the machine better. This is for sure not the best
  solution but at least something we can look at 

&gt;<i> However, if we provide a simple means for a system admin to create the 
</I>&gt;<i> mapping link, and keep it in place as a &quot;fall-back&quot; for when the 
</I>&gt;<i> auto-mapping functionality has been implemented, I think that would address 
</I>&gt;<i> that issue. I believe that this is really the part that needs discussion 
</I>&gt;<i> itself, trying to find a means of extending the current set of KIWI 
</I>&gt;<i> configuration elements with out requiring potentially drastic changes :/
</I>
agreed

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Definitely want some thoughts before moving forward with it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think it's worth to implement it :-)
</I>&gt;<i> Cool, if we can nail down the finer points specific to configuration 
</I>&gt;<i> changes and figure out a flexible enough stack map I am willing to work on 
</I>&gt;<i> the code changes to get us started, and open it up for the other developers 
</I>&gt;<i> once I have something stable, in addition to extending it as needed.
</I>
Sounds great. Concerning the configuration you only should keep the
system of key=value as I don't want to break the simple shell sourcing 
code inside the initrd. So I think it's not required to change currently
existing keys but the implementation will introduce a few new keys
for the mapping table which is not a problem at all imho. As long as
we didn't release it outside we are also free to change key names and
such

Your last two enhancements are already in as you might have seen.
So you have full support from my side to get that change in too :)
Concerning the project I have to keep an eye on not breaking existing
infrastructure and interfaces but I'm sure you are aware of that

Thanks for your effort

Regards,
Marcus
