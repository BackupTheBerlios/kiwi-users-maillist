<PRE>  Hi Marcus,

</I>Yes, correct, the first stack would allow for &quot;common&quot; application 
functionality to be configured, as well as the storage devices, thus far 
I can't think of a way to use mixed storage configurations with out 
breaking them out into another group. The second stack would link 
hardware specific components outside of the initial application 
configuration, for vendor specific components that are &quot;shipped&quot; with 
the hardware. So essentially the stack would:

Stage/Stack 1
1. Boot into the initrd, as it currently does.
2. Load the image, and other elements via the config.&lt;MAC&gt; or 
config.&lt;group_name&gt; files, depending on if the systems is linked to a 
group or not.

At this point Stage/Stack 2 kicks in (if the system admin has decided to 
use/configure it):
3. Check for hardware specific mapping files
4. If found, load the configurations into the image.

Then it continues to boot the kernel as it currently does.
&gt;<i> How do you plan to specify the vendor ? Do you want to use a unique
</I>&gt;<i> machine id ? I mean somehow we need to check which vendor map fits
</I>&gt;<i> to the machine we are currently on.
</I>I had not fully worked out this idea, so I was figuring the initial 
version would be configured by the system admins themselves, with kiwi 
based variables defined either in the config.group, or 
config.&lt;MAC&gt;/config.&lt;group_name&gt; files. As we got feed back in relation 
to it, we could slowly work in some form of automated methodology to map 
the hardware to a known list, or something. This would require research 
into the vendors and hardware suppliers to create that mapping file, 
however, and would need community involvement for sure. The automated 
method could not take into account hardware that had additional add-ons, 
such as PCI based serial cards or additional network interfaces, as that 
would have been a vendor -&gt; customer agreement, ontop of the base 
hardware configuration. Unless we created an &quot;add-ons&quot; map, that would 
be optionally activated as needed, but again we'd need the base code 
components there before we even considered that.

However, if we provide a simple means for a system admin to create the 
mapping link, and keep it in place as a &quot;fall-back&quot; for when the 
auto-mapping functionality has been implemented, I think that would 
address that issue. I believe that this is really the part that needs 
discussion itself, trying to find a means of extending the current set 
of KIWI configuration elements with out requiring potentially drastic 
changes :/

Doing so such that both single hardware configurations (config.&lt;MAC&gt;) 
benefit, in addition to the group ones. That would maintain consistent 
behavior between a config.&lt;MAC&gt; file and a config.&lt;group_name&gt; file...

&gt;&gt;<i> Definitely want some thoughts before moving forward with it.
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's worth to implement it :-)
</I>Cool, if we can nail down the finer points specific to configuration 
changes and figure out a flexible enough stack map I am willing to work 
on the code changes to get us started, and open it up for the other 
developers once I have something stable, in addition to extending it as 
needed.
