</I>
So there's another question then. Shouldn't a user, not root, be allowed 
to run kiwi --createpassword?

Here is my problem. If I am user X on my build system and I want to have 
a user Y in my image how can I generate a password for this user? The 
kiwi --createpassword can only be run as root, therefore, based on the 
previous discussion the returned string from the call cannot be used for 
user Y in the image.

Also it appears to me that based on this any user that I want in my 
image will have to exist on the build machine if I want to generate the 
password.

BTW, I am working on supporting plain text passwords in config.xml, 
which is the reason I ended up opening this can of worms in the first place.

  You
&gt;<i> can create password encryption with any other tool and use that
</I>&gt;<i> value in your config.xml.
</I>
This is the part I don't understand and my original point. If I generate 
an encrypted password with the DES algorithm, as is currently the case, 
then use this in config.xml, which means it ends up in etc/shadow, and 
than the created image uses blowfish, because that's the distribution 
default, how can a match ever occur? Wouldn't different algorithms come 
up with a different encryption? For a successful login something has to 
match somewhere along the way.

Obviously I have very little understanding on how this stuff works thus 
I apologize if these are really stupid questions.

Thanks,
Robert
