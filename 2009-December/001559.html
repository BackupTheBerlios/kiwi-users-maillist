<PRE>After my previous attempts to use earlier config files with the latest
kiwi on openSUSE 11.2, I decided to start from the beginning from a set
of example files. I have been trying to get this to work, but whatever I
am doing seems to be unstable. Booting is iffy. Of course, it could be
the network. But I do not see any other problems on it. So I do not
think that is the problem.

The problem in debugging this is that the text scrolls off the screen so
fast that I cannot see exactly where the problem occurs. I have
kiwidebug=1 on the command line, but there is no shell when it fails.

My question is; how can I get to see this text that is zipping by?
Without knowing what is failing, I cannot know where to start.  Can kiwi
be told to use a serial port as the console? If so, then maybe I can use
a terminal emulator with a scroll buffer to capture the complaints.




The failure is after the ethernet devices are brought up when the boot
prints:

Setting up (localfs) ethernet interfaces:

...

Waiting for mandatory devices:
  eth0 _NCS_
26 25 ... 1

I see that there is a DHCPDISCOVER (1) when the system boots and (2)
when the kiwi config file is read. I would have expected there to have
been one at this time as well. But there is not.

I do not know that this is why it is failing as, at this time, lots of
messages are printed so I cannot see the problem. The messages are like
&quot;Cannot execute /sbin/mingetty&quot;. I think the root file system is not
getting mounted.

The odd thing is that is works in some kiwi builds, and not others. If
I, for example, only remove the alsa package, the problem starts.

So, if I could see the messages, I could probably sort this out.

(I feel like an idiot with my problems all the time. So, bear with me
please...)
