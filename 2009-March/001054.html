<PRE>Hello,

I am having troubles installing a live openSUSE 11.1 on my usb thumb drive. 
Each time I try, the install works for a day or two then I get major 
filesystem errors and eventually cause the install to fail to boot.

I used Yast Image Creator to build the usbboot image and then use kiwi from 
the command line to install the image onto the thumb drive.

Is there something I should be setting within the OS on the thumbdrive?

What I am trying to do is build a live USB install of openSUSE 11.1 with the 
following packages:

KDE 4.2.1
OpenOffice 3.0.1
kde4-kile
textlive
scilab
all other apps are from the OSS repo

I have tried creating the usb image with all those apps as well as an image 
with just openSUSE 11.1 and KDE 4.2.1.

I capped the usbboot image to 7710 MB. Once all those apps are installed I 
have about 3.6GB free.

For my latest attempt I installed just opensuse and kde. Then I booted into 
the thumb drive and used The Smart Package Manager to install the other apps.

As soon as I had all the apps installed, the drive started to fail. /usr/bin 
contained entries from 1969, I saw /usr/bin/sed: Permission Denied when 
logging in as root, /var/log/messages contained entries that said I was trying 
to access files outside of the partition (??).

I have tried both ext3 and ext2. I turned on directory indexing and also 
turned off file and directory access times (noatime,nodiratime in fstab).

The USB drive is new. It's a Corsair Flash Survivor 8GB. It's made of 
&quot;airplane steel&quot;. I bought it because it's rugged and should be able to take a 
beating.

What special considerations are needed when creating a USB live image?

Thanks,

Alvin
