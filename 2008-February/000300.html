<PRE>Hi,

I have added Stephan Binner, he might be interested in this too

&gt;<i> after upgrading to kiwi 2.19.28.1 and livesystem 1.57.27.1, both ISO 
</I>&gt;<i> live images and flash images boot correctly and start the KDE desktop 
</I>&gt;<i> (since I selected the KDE profile).
</I>
sounds good

&gt;<i> However, I added the right &quot;keytable= de-latin1-nodeadkeys.map.gz&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> locale for Germany, but the KDE desktop still is coming up in US English 
</I>&gt;<i> and the keyboard is set to english-us,pc104.
</I>
Hmm, what exactly does that mean ? Did you provide the file
/etc/sysconfig/keyboard along with your image description ? I guess
the problem is the creation of the xorg.conf file. We use sax2 to do
the job and sax2 takes a look into the sysconfig/keyboard file to
map the console keyboard layout into the X keyboard layout. If it
runs X in English as you said I guess your console keyboard layout
is also in English. You can try to edit the sysconfig/keyboard
file and after that run sax2 again.

kiwi creates the keyboard setup by the function suseConfig() which
should be called in your config.sh as part of the image description.
The suseConfig function evaluates the contents of the optionally
set &lt;keytable&gt; section as part of the &lt;preferences&gt; section. Did you
have set that ?

&gt;<i> Yes, I selected &quot;German&quot; from the boot manager (German and English are 
</I>&gt;<i> selectable). Some applications are coming up in English (firefox), while 
</I>&gt;<i> the same application package uses German locale if installed in a 
</I>&gt;<i> regular desktop installation.
</I>
The problem here is that we currently don't hand over the value here
from the initrd into the system. We are still searching for a general
setup because in a normal installation yast is doing that for us but
it also has to work if no yast is in place

&gt;<i> So I guess I am missing some packages for localization plus some of the 
</I>&gt;<i> settings in config.xml are incorrect or not used, since the localization 
</I>&gt;<i> is not in the first step physical image. Is there a package list for a 
</I>&gt;<i> German KDE or GNOME desktop installation?
</I>
I think for English and German all should be in place. If you have more
complex languages like for example Japanese there might be some fonts
missing. I think you should give it a try with the KDE keyboard selector.
It's this nice litle application in your taskbar showing a flag as indicator
for the currently used keyboard. If you click on it you can change the
keyboard setup on the fly. It has worked for me and you could make sure
if all required software is there to be able to use the keyboard you like.
If it works we are only dealing with a configuration problem

&gt;<i> If I want to enable multiple desktops to choose from on Live DVD startup 
</I>&gt;<i> (like GNOME, KDE and some other things), does kiwi already support this? 
</I>&gt;<i> So I would not have to create multiple live images; most users have a 
</I>&gt;<i> DVD drive or a large enough flash anyway.
</I>
To choose different window/desktop managers at login is implemented in
the KDE and GNome login managers (kdm/gdm) so as soon as they are installed
in parallel you have the possibility to choose between the two anyway.
For kiwi this means you need to call the prepare step with

	--add-profile KDE,GNOME

What we don't support is to choose for a desktop environment at boot
time. I don't want to have the complexity of switching desktop environments
within the initrd.

Regards,
Marcus
