<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I've been using the &lt;split&gt; element, hoping I could achieve
</I>&gt;<i> a read-only diskful image. But after building several images and
</I>&gt;<i> looking through the kiwi modules, I think &quot;read-only&quot; might be a
</I>&gt;<i> misnomer.  To me,	read-only implies that no writes are possible;
</I>&gt;<i> yet when the image is	booted, a mount command shows that this
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;read-only&quot; partition is mounted read-write. I think I understand
</I>&gt;<i> the read-write partition to allow some file persistence.
</I>
It is true we are mounting the read-only partition read-write.
We do that because we assume the read-only partition to use a
read-only filesystem like for example squashfs. But in principal
you are right we should add a

	-o ro 

to the mount of the read-only part. Snorp I think we should change:

	if ! mount -t auto $roDevice /read-only &gt;/dev/null;then
        return 1
    fi

to

	if ! mount -t auto -o ro $roDevice /read-only &gt;/dev/null;then
        return 1
    fi

&gt;<i> I'm also having a hard time understanding the logic
</I>&gt;<i> behind the contortions in the mountSystemCombined function from
</I>&gt;<i> KIWILinuxRC.sh:
</I>
Ha Ha yeah that's a bit magic and should be more documented. I'll
try to explain:

 1) mount the read-only partition to a /read-only mount point
 2) mount a tmpfs to /mnt and extract the writable but temporary
    in RAM data into it (tarball) /mnt will become the later
    root directory (/)
 3) create a read-only mountpoint below /mnt
 4) move the /read-only mount into the tmpfs (/mnt) mount
    all the read-only links which have been created as part of the tarball
    will become valid if /mnt becomes /
 *  NOW OPTIONALLY
 5) mount the read-write partition to a /mnt/read-write mount point
 6) create a link named /read-write because all the links created
    in the tarball are pointing to /read-write

===&gt; now move /mnt to / and got the tree
===&gt; I know it's weird. Snorp would you mind to add some comments
     to your magic :-) Thanks 

&gt;<i> What am I missing???  Can I use the &lt;split&gt; element to
</I>&gt;<i> achieve an image where no disk writes are possible to the read-only
</I>&gt;<i> partition, unless I specifically remount it read-write?
</I>
I think yes if we add the -o ro option. Anyway you shouldn't
see any write action to /read-only at the moment 

&gt;<i> Also, what is the effect of using &quot;ext3,cramfs&quot; as the
</I>&gt;<i> filesystem attribute for the &lt;type&gt; element?  Does this make the
</I>&gt;<i> read-write partition a cramfs filesystem?  If so, then what is the
</I>&gt;<i> meaning of read-write in this case?  Note: I haven't successfully
</I>&gt;<i> used cramfs because I keep exceeding the cramfs size limit.
</I>
First of all I have dropped support for cramfs because it has
a size limit which is not acceptable for system images. People always
run into that issue and squashfs is the better compressed filesystem
and doesn't have that problem

the effect of &quot;ext3,cramfs&quot; would be an ext3 based read-write partition
and a cramfs based read-only partition. In this case the mount options
wouldn't matter because you can mount it only read-only. People use
the split type most often with:

	filesystem=&quot;ext3,squashfs&quot;

which means put all my &lt;split&gt; section data into an ext3 partition
and use the rest as compressed read-only squashfs based data

Hope that helps a bit ?

Regards,
Marcus
