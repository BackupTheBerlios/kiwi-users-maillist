<PRE>Hi,

by no means a dumb question :)

&gt;<i> Does kiwi take any files from the system on which you build it other
</I>&gt;<i> than those installed by kiwi (in some place private to kiwi and not part
</I>&gt;<i> of the system in general) or that are in a repository specified in your
</I>&gt;<i> config.xml file?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Could the current release of kiwi be installed on, say, a SUSE 10.0
</I>&gt;<i> system and, using a 10.3 repository, make 10.3 images?
</I>
It was designed to allow this yes. I have tested creating 10.3 images
if installed on 10.1 and this works pretty well. One problem I see
if you have a very old version of rpm it may be required to convert
(rebuilddb) the rpm database when entering the kiwi chroot phase.

If you start preparing an image you start with an empty directory and
if you use rpm based repositories the very first rpm database setup
happens with the rpm installed on your build machine. Let's say you
are creating an image for 10.3 than the rpm version of 10.3 will be
part of your new root tree and as soon as kiwi switches into the
chroot to proceed the image preparation it find an rpm database created
by an older version. This is not a problem as long as the rpm
versions are compatible in their db format and version. if they are
not compatible the database needs to be converted. This is done
by calling rpm --rebuilddb

 * at the moment this rebuilddb call is not implemented because
   I didn't needed it so far

 * I'm also not sure if rebuilding works if the rpm version are
   incompatible in their db version 

 * I didn't test other package managers like dpkg

I can guarantee it will work from 10.1 to latest version of suse (at
the moment 11.0) _and vice versa_ What happens if your OS version is
older I don't know exactly.

I would really appreciate any feedback/ideas if someone already
stumbled over that problem

Regards,
Marcus
