&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have added Stephan Binner, he might be interested in this too
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> after upgrading to kiwi 2.19.28.1 and livesystem 1.57.27.1, both ISO 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> live images and flash images boot correctly and start the KDE desktop 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (since I selected the KDE profile).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> sounds good
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, I added the right &quot;keytable= de-latin1-nodeadkeys.map.gz&quot; and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> locale for Germany, but the KDE desktop still is coming up in US English 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the keyboard is set to english-us,pc104.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, what exactly does that mean ? Did you provide the file
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/sysconfig/keyboard along with your image description ? 
</I>No, I did not know that this was the correct method to configure 
language / keyboard settings :-)
I found the settings for keytable and language in SuseConfig, so I 
assumed the german keyboard setting was somehow &quot;guessed&quot; by these 
options. My fault ;-)
Maybe there should be a &lt;keyboard&gt; tag in config.xml?
If keytable is set to de-latin1, but keyboard is left to US-English, 
this is not what one would expect...

&gt;<i> I guess
</I>&gt;<i> the problem is the creation of the xorg.conf file. We use sax2 to do
</I>&gt;<i> the job and sax2 takes a look into the sysconfig/keyboard file to
</I>&gt;<i> map the console keyboard layout into the X keyboard layout. If it
</I>&gt;<i> runs X in English as you said I guess your console keyboard layout
</I>&gt;<i> is also in English. You can try to edit the sysconfig/keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> file and after that run sax2 again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Hmmm, after I modified keyboard to the correct value now, the console 
has German keys now, but in KDE, the US flag is still showing. Even if I 
switch that to German, this setting is not persistent and at next 
startup, US English is still the X-Default. Sax2 does not change this, 
so perhaps my sysconfig is broken somewhere.
Probably I can set the right values in Xorg.conf, I will try this out on 
the weekend.
&gt;<i> kiwi creates the keyboard setup by the function suseConfig() which
</I>&gt;<i> should be called in your config.sh as part of the image description.
</I>&gt;<i> The suseConfig function evaluates the contents of the optionally
</I>&gt;<i> set &lt;keytable&gt; section as part of the &lt;preferences&gt; section. Did you
</I>&gt;<i> have set that ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes,  but it does not change the keyboard setting on the bottom of the 
file, only the keytable?
&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, I selected &quot;German&quot; from the boot manager (German and English are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> selectable). Some applications are coming up in English (firefox), while 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same application package uses German locale if installed in a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regular desktop installation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem here is that we currently don't hand over the value here
</I>&gt;<i> from the initrd into the system. We are still searching for a general
</I>&gt;<i> setup because in a normal installation yast is doing that for us but
</I>&gt;<i> it also has to work if no yast is in place
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I rebuilt everything and added kde3-i18n to config.xml, now most apps 
are in German as expected.
Only Firefox and Thunderbird still remain in English, so perhaps the 
default package does not contain the locales for Germany - I will check 
this now.

&gt;&gt;<i> If I want to enable multiple desktops to choose from on Live DVD startup 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (like GNOME, KDE and some other things), does kiwi already support this? 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So I would not have to create multiple live images; most users have a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DVD drive or a large enough flash anyway.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To choose different window/desktop managers at login is implemented in
</I>&gt;<i> the KDE and GNome login managers (kdm/gdm) so as soon as they are installed
</I>&gt;<i> in parallel you have the possibility to choose between the two anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> For kiwi this means you need to call the prepare step with
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	--add-profile KDE,GNOME
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>This is quite sufficient for our purposes, thanks for the hint.
&gt;<i> What we don't support is to choose for a desktop environment at boot
</I>&gt;<i> time. I don't want to have the complexity of switching desktop environments
</I>&gt;<i> within the initrd.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>No, this is not necessary really. KDM is fine, it's just that I did not 
want to have 2 different live images for KDE and GNOME.

Thanks a lot! Hopefully I can figure out how to change the keyboard 
persistently, this is really weird.

Bernd
