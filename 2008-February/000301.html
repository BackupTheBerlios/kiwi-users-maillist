<PRE>Hi Roger,

&gt;<i> 1) If I do not specify a kernel in my config.xml file, I still get a set
</I>&gt;<i> of images. However, after the kernel boots and the nbd image is
</I>&gt;<i> accessed, I get a message that the kernel versions do not match. Of
</I>&gt;<i> course, I will always specify a kernel, but I was surprised that this
</I>&gt;<i> happened. What is used if I do not specify a kernel?
</I>
The reason for the kernelCheck function is the following. If you boot
an image via network the client has to receive the kernel and the
initrd (kiwi boot image) first. The client loads and according to the
deployment method it downloads the system image or mounts a remote
tree via NFS or NBD. The later happens in your case. The problem here
is if the initrd provides another kernel than the system image, in your
case the NBD root tree, you will have problems to load any kernel module
which hasn't been loaded within the initrd already. As Linux has the
concept of modules it is most likely the case that you need additional
kernel modules which are not required to _boot_ the image but required
to use the operating system with all it's features later on.

Because of that kiwi checks the kernel version in RAM with the kernel
provided by the system image. In your case with the kernel provided by
the exported NBD root tree.

I'm wondering why you don't require a kernel in your image. Is it
because you really don't need any additional kernel module when your
system boots ? USB is a good example here. For booting you most often
don't required any USB module but later on you may want to use your
USB mouse or another USB hardware which requires you to have the USB
modules loadable. So you need them to be installed in your system image
and of course for the right kernel version

&gt;<i> 2) Maybe I missed this one in the docs: I can specify a kernel in either
</I>&gt;<i> the boot or the image part of my config.xml. Do either places have
</I>&gt;<i> specific advantages? I am now specifying kernel-default in the boot
</I>&gt;<i> section. I would have thought this would result in all the kernel
</I>&gt;<i> modules being in the initrd image. And not in the nbd image. But the
</I>&gt;<i> modules are in the nbd image. Is there a good description of this part
</I>&gt;<i> of kiwi?
</I>
I think we agree that we urgently need a kernel in the kiwi boot
images (the initrd's) otherwise we can't boot, right ? ;) the question
whether we need a kernel in the system image depends on if you need
kernel modules or kernel information in your later system image too
because the initrd is gone (RAM only). If you remove the kernel-default
package name in your config.xml it still can happen that a kernel
is installed because of package requirements. If you really don't want
a kernel in the system image you can remove the package manually as
part of the &lt;packages type=&quot;delete&quot;&gt; section and reference that to be
removed in images.sh.

&gt;<i> 3) I have removed all references to X in my config.xml file. I do not
</I>&gt;<i> think any packages I have specified use X. But X keeps getting pulled
</I>&gt;<i> in. Is there anything in kiwi itself that could cause this behavior?
</I>
no kiwi itself doesn't require X at all. It's really hard to make sure
there is _no_ reference to any X library, program... whatever. I have an 
example image description provided with kiwi which doesn't install X

Hope that helps

Regards,
Marcus
