</I>&gt;<i> the exported NBD root tree.

I do need and want a kernel :) I was just playing with where I specified
the kernel: in the boot or in the image part. Just to see what effect,
if any, this had. In one test, I did not specify it in either. I
expected the image build to fail. To my surprise it did not fail. But
the boot only got so far. Thus my question.

&gt;<i> system boots ? USB is a good example here. For booting you most often
</I>&gt;<i> don't required any USB module but later on you may want to use your
</I>&gt;<i> USB mouse or another USB hardware which requires you to have the USB
</I>&gt;<i> modules loadable. So you need them to be installed in your system image
</I>&gt;<i> and of course for the right kernel version
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) Maybe I missed this one in the docs: I can specify a kernel in either
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the boot or the image part of my config.xml. Do either places have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specific advantages? I am now specifying kernel-default in the boot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; section. I would have thought this would result in all the kernel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; modules being in the initrd image. And not in the nbd image. But the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; modules are in the nbd image. Is there a good description of this part
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of kiwi?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think we agree that we urgently need a kernel in the kiwi boot
</I>&gt;<i> images (the initrd's) otherwise we can't boot, right ? ;) the question
</I>&gt;<i> whether we need a kernel in the system image depends on if you need
</I>&gt;<i> kernel modules or kernel information in your later system image too
</I>&gt;<i> because the initrd is gone (RAM only). If you remove the kernel-default
</I>&gt;<i> package name in your config.xml it still can happen that a kernel
</I>&gt;<i> is installed because of package requirements. If you really don't want
</I>&gt;<i> a kernel in the system image you can remove the package manually as
</I>&gt;<i> part of the &lt;packages type=&quot;delete&quot;&gt; section and reference that to be
</I>&gt;<i> removed in images.sh.
</I>
OK. But I have been playing with your nice wyse setup. In there, you
remove unused kernel modules via the images.sh script. This works fine
for me as well, so I plan on using that method. Given the name of the
script, I am guessing that this only removes modules from the system
image. What modules are in the boot image? Is there any control over
that?

&gt;<i> &gt; 3) I have removed all references to X in my config.xml file. I do not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think any packages I have specified use X. But X keeps getting pulled
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in. Is there anything in kiwi itself that could cause this behavior?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> no kiwi itself doesn't require X at all. It's really hard to make sure
</I>&gt;<i> there is _no_ reference to any X library, program... whatever. I have an 
</I>&gt;<i> example image description provided with kiwi which doesn't install X
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	/usr/share/doc/packages/kiwi/examples/test2
</I>
I think this gets X as well: hal-&gt;PolicyKit-&gt;ConsoleKit-&gt;libx11.so.6

The offending package is ConsoleKit, which gets pulled in just about
anywhere. Which means you will probably always have X. I think the
'best' that can be done is to remove X from the image, knowing that it
will not be needed. At least the obvious parts can be deleted.

Given that ConsoleKit should presumably work at run level 3, I am
confused how it can require x11. I would think it should be sensed
dynamically. But that is an issue for the ConsoleKit guys.

&gt;<i> Hope that helps
</I>
Yes indeed. I am happily booting and all. I am just playing with
refinements and image trimming.
