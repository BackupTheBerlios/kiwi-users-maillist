<PRE>==================================================
Changes Report v4.36 2010-05-09 - 2010-05-14
--------------------------------------------------
most important changes for this weeks kiwi release...

==============================
System to image migration
------------------------------
GIT: fixed in place search field text
GIT: fixed some typo in migration js
GIT: activate javascript in migration report
GIT: added search field for unpackaged file list on the
     generated migration report page
GIT: disabled autoyastClone() temporarly, we need to find a way to
     call that only on &gt;= 11.3 systems
GIT: migration changes:
     * automatically copy the packaged but modified files
       into the overlay section and don't put them into the report
     * create a HTML file list for the unpackaged files
       to browse through and update the text.

Basically all these changes makes the migration to work
smarter. All files packaged but changed will be automatically
setup up as overlay files because it has turned out that these
files are required in 90% of all cases and those bits which
wouldn't be really required are only a small amount of space
inside the overlay root tree. The more complex part are the
files which are not packaged. Those files needs to be presented
in a way that makes it easy for the user to browse through.
There is still some work to do here but we started to add
a fast search field which also needs some improvements

==============================
LUKS support
------------------------------
GIT: revert last change to Dialog function and fixed luksOpen
     function to use the runInteractive() method for dialogs with
     input fields

GIT: fixed probeFileSystem function for luks detection.
     blkid returned crypto_LUKS which was missing in the
     case section

Hans Witvliet's report leads to some tests I made with luks and LVM.
While doing this I found two smaller bugs which are fixed with
this weeks release.

==============================
Solvable creation
------------------------------
GIT: added .info file for cached solvables
     fixed solvable pattern creation. It's required to lookup susetags
     even if there is a repodata meta data information to be able to
     create a full featured solvable including all pattern names

When using kiwi for migration or also for querying information
about package lists and other repo metadata related tasks it will
first create a sat solvable to operate on. The solvable also includes
information about patterns which was missing when for distribution
repositories like openSUSE 11.2. The suse specific pattern information
was not downloaded which is fixed now.

==============================
Imaging building
------------------------------
GIT: fixed rpmLibs() function, need ldconfig after cleanup

When building images for older distros for example SLES10 on a new
build host for example 11.2, kiwi temporarly incorporates some
libraries from the build system in order to let rpm work correctly.
These libs were restored after the bootstrap step and it is
required to create the library links via ldconfig again. This 
call was missing which leads to an inconsistent system

Have fun :-)

Marcus
