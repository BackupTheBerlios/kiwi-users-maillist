<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> It is a great feature, I ever hear. I think, I love Kiwi. ;-)
</I>
:<i>-)
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; 2) you can use zypper or smart inside the image after the first
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    deployment. So if your system runs and you have installed for example
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    smart you can add the update repository with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       smart channel add ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       smart upgrade 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    depending on the image type the changes might be in RAM only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    ( for example on live ISO's) so this might not be a good idea
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This suggestion isn't a good idea, but it can implemented in an emergency.
</I>&gt;<i> If someone need software from repository, so it can add easier to 
</I>&gt;<i> running system.
</I>&gt;<i> But at next reboot, all added or updated software are gone. :-/
</I>
for the iso type, yes you are right

&gt;<i> My next step are compiling a software and adding this to live cd.
</I>&gt;<i> I think, the step to compile for live cd as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. ./configure --prefix=/usr
</I>&gt;<i> 2. make
</I>&gt;<i> 3. copy source directory to the same subfolder in live-cd-directory like 
</I>&gt;<i> the host-system
</I>&gt;<i> 4. chrooting into the new system and install with command &quot;make install&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But some execute file need library, so I find out the shared library 
</I>&gt;<i> with &quot;readelf -d program&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and adding the missing library to the package of config.xml. Right?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is that the best way to add any compiled software to live cd?
</I>
The best way is to package your software put the result into a
directory and set that directory along with a coresponding &lt;package&gt;
line as additional repository in your config.xml

That's the best and the cleanest solution but also the most time
consuming one.

If I had to compile from source I also do that within the new root
tree (chroot). This means I have to have all software to compile the
program installed in my new root tree. People might say this is bad
because the devlopment kit is needed only to compile but not to
run the software. That's true but it's a clean way to compile the
code

The solution you've chosen works too but it's easy to stumble over
multiple possible traps:

- if the host you compile the software on is not on the same version
  compared to the system in your new root tree, the compiled binary
  could work but don't have to

- the configure call resolves the buld environment correctly but
  there is no guarantee that this requirements are also correct in
  your new root tree. If you copy the tree after make and run make
  install inside the new root you risk a broken installation.
  missing libraries are only one problem there could be other
  programs/configurations missing.
   
I think if it's your own software or a small program you can go
that way but don't try to do that with for example openoffice :-)
There are also many public repositories out there which package nearly
every program.

Regards,
Marcus
