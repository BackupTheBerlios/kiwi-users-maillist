<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I am using whatever is in the preload example. I would expect that at
</I>&gt;<i> least to boot. Whatever foolish things I may then attempt would be my
</I>&gt;<i> own problem. Perhaps this is a 11.3 thing. I hope not...
</I>
ok now I understand. you just used the oem-preload examples from
the kiwi-doc package. I have changed the filesystem type to ext3
for the 11.2 example and I also removed the split sections from
these examples which means the kiwi default split setup applies.
That works then as expected

One side note. The examples in the kiwi-doc package didn't go
through QA. So if you want to be sure an example works install
the official kiwi-templates package and use of the JeOS image
descriptions provided there. So far we have the following JeOS's

  suse-11.1-JeOS
  suse-11.2-JeOS
  suse-11.3-JeOS
  suse-11.4-JeOS
  suse-SLE10-JeOS
  suse-SLE11-JeOS 

&gt;<i> What I thought I was doing was making an image that I could boot, and it
</I>&gt;<i> would (1) copy an image on to a hard disk, (2) the partitions resized,
</I>&gt;<i> (3) some yast questions asked (license, timezone, etc) (4) and then the
</I>&gt;<i> system operate as a 'regular' system (not split).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the preload scenario, it seems that #1 and #2 are happening as I
</I>&gt;<i> expected. #3 and #4 are not.
</I>
@3

in case of a split system the system can't be a 'regular' system because
with our standard installation procedure we don't support that. Only
kiwi can do that. So you can't compare this. For any other type except
live iso's the system works like it does if you would have installed
it with yast.

@4

kiwi doesn't depend on yast. You can create an OS completely without yast.
If you want yast to be in the game you have to setup a autoyast
workflow for it. This means you call 'yast autoyast' setup what configuration
dialogs you want to run and provide the resulting yast xml description
to the kiwi XML description. kiwi then imports this information and
calls yast as configuration utility on first boot. yast for kiwi has
is only a configuration tool, it can't be used to install the system
because that's all done by kiwi due to the appliance design. That's
point where an appliance is different from a menu driven installation
procedure
 
&gt;<i> As to #3, I have seen this working with a live image on a USB stick. It
</I>&gt;<i> seemed to work rather well. 
</I>
yes it does. The preloads we have done for Lenovo and HP makes
use of it as well

&gt;<i> Can I make a preload system that is not split, and all is in partitions
</I>&gt;<i> as you would get in an install?
</I>
sure build a JeOS with image type oem. But by default this will
not call yast. If you want that you need to enhance the image
description by a config-yast-autoyast.xml file which you create
with 'yast2 autoyast'. Additionally you need to make sure that
autoyast is installed.

I have attached an example image description which I used
for a training session recently. I think it's pretty much
what you want. You can build it as follows:

   kiwi --build suse-11.3-live -d /tmp/myimage --type oem \
        --set-repo &lt;path-to-11.3-repo&gt;

Regards,
Marcus
