</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> cannot be removed/ignored.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is correct. I implemented the ignore element for the packages

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &lt;packages type=&quot;delete&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    &lt;package name=&quot;lxde-common-branding-openSUSE&quot;/&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &lt;/packages&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and make sure your config.sh includes the following function call:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  suseRemovePackagesMarkedForDeletion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is my last post on this subject in this mailing list. I apologize
</I>&gt;<i> to the Build Service ML about this off subject post.   I've sent an
</I>&gt;<i> email to subscribe to the Kiwi ML but haven't received a reply yet.
</I>&gt;<i> Robert S.  If you have any way to speed up my subscription to this ML please do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> None of the last few suggestions have worked.  I'm a bit confused on
</I>&gt;<i> this issue.  Isn't this rebrand situation one of the more common uses
</I>&gt;<i> for Kiwi? 
</I>
Maybe yes, but I do not know. For re-branding people may not necessarily
create their own packages, but rather use the method documented here:

<A HREF="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:KIWI_Cookbook_Splash_Screen#Custom_GRUB_and_boot_splash_images">http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:KIWI_Cookbook_Splash_Screen#Custom_GRUB_and_boot_splash_images</A>

Thus, there are no packaging conflicts. Further the branding packages
are generally separate as in

bootsplash-branding-openSUSE
gfxboot-branding-openSUSE

rather than being part of a pattern. You are running into trouble
because the definition of the LXDE pattern includes the branding packages.

These branding packages for some reason or another cause a conflict.
However, that there is a conflict sounds fishy to begin with. I suspect
that your branding packages are putting files in the same location as
the distribution supplied packages and that's why the conflict is
triggered. Different branding packages should put their files into
different directories, then there is no opportunity for conflicts.
Anyway, I am going on a &quot;clean up the world&quot; tangent now and will stop.

&gt;<i> I would have thought that replacing a default SUSE package
</I>&gt;<i> with and OEM branding package would be fairly common, no?
</I>
Probably, as mentioned above the packages are separate by default and
thus in the &quot;common&quot; case one just does not install the openSUSE
branding packages. The problem is the pattern.

&gt;<i> I was told by at least 3 Novell guys that the &quot;delete&quot; section is used
</I>&gt;<i> to remove the package during the configuration of the installed OS.
</I>&gt;<i> So anything added to the &quot;delete&quot; section (in the config.xml/kiwi
</I>&gt;<i> file) will not have any effect on this problem as this problem has to
</I>&gt;<i> do with the package being installed by the pattern in the image's
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;prepare&quot; stages of the build. 
</I>
Yes, delete happens after the install.

&gt;<i> Also it appears that adding the line &quot;
</I>&gt;<i> suseRemovePackagesMarkedForDeletion&quot; as suggested will also have no
</I>&gt;<i> effect on this issue as that script (config.sh) runs after the
</I>&gt;<i> packages are &quot;installed&quot; in the &quot;prepare&quot; stage of the kiwi image
</I>&gt;<i> build.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I am very surprised with is that the &quot;replaces&quot; element added to
</I>&gt;<i> the package line doesn't work either.  That was really disappointing.
</I>&gt;<i> I thought for sure this would work.  The other thing that makes no
</I>&gt;<i> sense is how clearly the kiwi docs .pdf file states that if this
</I>&gt;<i> problem exists...then use the &quot;ignore&quot; element to resolve it.
</I>
I will take a look at the doc and re-word it to make this less
ambiguous. I'll submit a patch for this.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So does this mean that I now have to add each package that each
</I>&gt;<i> pattern contains and leave out the ones that are being replaced by our
</I>&gt;<i> OEM packages?
</I>
Yes, and no. You can take the approach of basically expanding the list
of packages that are part of the pattern in the config.xml file.
However, the root cause is really not the use of the pattern but rather
the packages that cause the conflict. If I were in your shoes I would
work on understanding why the packages conflict and then fix the
conflicts, I know back to &quot;clean up the world&quot; mode.

If you just have newer versions of things that are already there you can
just give your packages higher version numbers. The package manager will
pick them up automatically and you do not have to list them in
config.xml at all.

&gt;<i> If so how can we confirm EXACTLY what packages are contained in the
</I>&gt;<i> pattern package? 
</I>
Information about patterns are found in suse/setup/descr/ on the media.
I do not know where the source of the patterns resides, probably
somewhere in the buildservice.

&gt;<i> I've tried Yast GUI under Patterns. This proved to
</I>&gt;<i> be not an accurate means of  packages contained in the pattern.
</I>&gt;<i> Is the rule of thumb that if your doing a rebrand of SUSE you can't
</I>&gt;<i> use Patterns in your config.xml /kiwi file?
</I>
No, this is a problem with the LXDE pattern. IMHO, the LXDE pattern
should not contain the branding packages, but at the same token your own
branding packages should not put files into locations used by packages
that get delivered with the distribution.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I noticed (before this branding/replacement issue) that having
</I>&gt;<i> patterns in the config.xml file would cause another unwanted issue and
</I>&gt;<i> that is after the final ISO image is made and your using the installed
</I>&gt;<i> iso/image that you just made with Kiwi if you open Yast's GUI Package
</I>&gt;<i> Manager it will got out and try to install tons of packages that were
</I>&gt;<i> intentionally left out of the package list in my config.xml file. So
</I>&gt;<i> even though only the packages that I wanted were installed (I can
</I>&gt;<i> confirm this by just looking around in the working OS) when Yast is
</I>&gt;<i> opened it wants to download/upgrade all the packages that were in the
</I>&gt;<i> patterns.....I guess that's where it's getting this list from.
</I>
A couple of thoughts on this. First if you are building your image
without including the online update repositories, or an up to date local
copy thereof, then you should expect the package manager to tell you
about available updates if the updates repo is configured. If you don't
configure the updates repo on the system you are building then you will
not have this issue. Second, you probably have a difference between
recommended and required packages. In your config.xml file I suspect you
use patternType=&quot;onlyRequired&quot;. Then when you fire up the package
manager on your image it will probably look for the recommended packages
as well. Thus, you get a list of additional packages to install. I do
not know how to tell the YaST package manager via configuration to
ignore recommended packages.

Another role in this is obviously played by the configured repositories
in your image. If you do not configure any repos then the package
manager has nothing to pull packages from.

Thus your update strategy has a major impact on this behavior.

&gt;<i> So, what is the best way to confirm what packages are contained in the
</I>&gt;<i> patterns. 
</I>
Look in the pattern definition, see above where to find it.

HTH,
Robert
