</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both would be a problem if the

</I>&gt;<i> How can the package manager update &quot;these files&quot; when according to your

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only thing that could happen is that an update overwrites the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would think the results would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be that my branding (at least the branding that was installed by one

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Will mentioned that since I have the RPM package for this branding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> package that it could be used in a similar way to Tar file method but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that I wouldn't get overwritten by the package manager during an

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> he mean that the RPM can be &quot;tar-ed&quot; and is installed like a tar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> file??
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I do not know what you mean. Since you appear to struggle with
</I>&gt;<i> this concept, have you tried to built the Kiwi example that shows how to
</I>&gt;<i> brand the bootmenu and splash screen? If not, you should follow this, it
</I>&gt;<i> might clarify many of the things you appear to have troubles with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I checked the kiwi PDF docs and can't find anything on this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can the RPM be &quot;forced&quot; in?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, Kiwi has no way to interact with the package manager other than
</I>&gt;<i> saying &quot;go install this stuff&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are sooo many questions I have regarding this sort of stuff.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When it comes to branding/re-branding that I'm at the mercy of whoever
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> packaged the originals Suse packages.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a way that if I built all the branding package that these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RPMs can be installed in to the image without the &quot;overwrite&quot; issues?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See my previous message about putting the rpms in the overlay tree and
</I>&gt;<i> then using config.sh to get the packages installed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would think that if the RPMs are of the branding packages are used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the PM would &quot;know&quot; that they are there as compared to the tar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and overlay method the PM wouldn't know the branding packages were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there. &#160;I guess it would be the difference between managed and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unmanaged package installations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If this is possible I assume the config.xml file would have to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tweaked to have the repos section allow for local installs of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RPMs?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Would the &quot;image.sh&quot; script have to actually install the RPMs?

Hi Robert,
Hey thanks again for the help on this.  I realize that I'm a bit thick
headed. It's not intentional.  After writing the developer/package of
LXDE I'm a bit disappointed with the reply. (displayed at the end of
this message)
Due to this I'm going to try placing my LXDE-common-branding-SOS
packaged RPM file in the overlay tree of Kiwi.  I've read the tutorial
on the GFXBoot and Bootsplash package and who it was integrated into
the kiwi image.  This seems very similar but instead of the package
contents being tared the will be be installed as an RPM.
I included in my &quot;config.sh&quot; file the commands

&quot;rpm -e --nodeps lxde-common-branding-openSUSE-11.3-54.2.noarch&quot;
&quot;rpm -i lxde-common-branding-SOS-11.3-30.1.noarch&quot;

A couple of questions.
1) Does the RPM command have to be placed in a specific place within
the config.sh file?
2) In the config.xml file I know I have to add a line or two.  Am I
adding an &lt;archive&gt; line?  I assume that this line would be just for
the Tar archive only.
Currently kiwi is pulling this lxde-common-branding-SOS package from
my repo but now it's going to be installing from a local source.  I
placed this RPM withing the overlay tree in /opt/branding/  How is
this done?
3) Do I also have to add the bootinclude=&quot;true&quot; string in the package line?
4) If the Tar archive is to be used I would place the tar file in the
kiwi discription directory with the &quot;root&quot; overlay folder, config.xml
and config.sh files correct?

I'm looking for a branding solution that will be consistent regardless
of what somebody else did in a spec file.  If including the said
branding package in RPM form works like this every time I would apt to
go with this method...or if the Tar archive is faster (I assume it
would be if the RPM isn't already made) then I would go in this
direction.

In this particular circumstance I have already made the RPM for this
package but for the sake of using one method (for now) should I just
download the source files from my RPM and tarball the contents.  It
seems like the end results is the same...and the config.sh file
wouldn't need to be tweaked as the RPMs wouldn't be used at all.


Reply from Andrea regarding the request to remove the &quot;Conflicts&quot; line
from the spec file of the lxde-common-branding-openSUSE package
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
that's the problem, they don't go in different folders and then the
conflicts.

you need to create a &quot;lxde-common-branding-whatever&quot;

and you need to include:

Provides:       lxde-common-branding = %{version}
Conflicts:      otherproviders(lxde-common-branding)
Supplements:    packageand(lxde-common:branding-whatever)

please take you time to check the file list of
&quot;lxde-common-branding-upstream&quot; and &quot;lxde-common-branding-openSUSE&quot;

p.s. is the first time i hear you can install more than 1 branding at
the sime time.. how are you supposed to switch between them after that?


Sorry for not being able to help you more.
Regards
Andrea

Thanks Robert
Chris
