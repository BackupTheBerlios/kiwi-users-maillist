<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> First of all I tried kiwi many times here on my pc with different openSUSE 
</I>&gt;<i> versions (from 11.1 to 11.4) and never had a success really in booting it 
</I>&gt;<i> successfully with my U3 USB stick.
</I>
I'm sorry that you had so much trouble with it. I hope the following
helps to get you started and I hope it's not too late concerning the
hard time you had ;)

1) I don't recommend to use kiwi on a distro not yet released.
   So I don't suggest to run it on 11.4 at the moment

2) use the kiwi packages from here:
   <A HREF="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Virtualization:/Appliances">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Virtualization:/Appliances</A>
   We fixed many many problems and you make the most out of it if you
   use that version

3) make sure you have the kiwi-templates package installed
   this package provides our JeOS (Just Enough Linux) example image
   descriptions. They are tested very well

4) if you have a good network connection you can build a live iso
   image as follows (Example 11.3):

   kiwi --build suse-11.3-JeOS -d /tmp/mylive --type iso

   if you don't have a good network connection. I suggest to copy
   a 11.3 DVD locally on your machine and point to that repo

   dd if=/dev/dvd of=/tmp/dvd.iso
   kiwi --build suse-11.3-JeOS -d /tmp/mylive --type iso \
        --set-repo <A HREF="iso:///tmp/dvd.iso">iso:///tmp/dvd.iso</A>

Without any changes the created iso will boot *last famous words*
Does that work for you ?

&gt;<i> As I found some time now to investigate the 
</I>&gt;<i> problem a little further I grabbed a openSUSE 11.4 M6 Hybrid LiveISO (KDE4 
</I>&gt;<i> variant) and tried it once again. As expected it didn't boot and gave me the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Couldn't find Live image configuration file&quot; error. 
</I>
That sounds bad. The 11.4 live iso is not created by me so I don't
know much about that image. Please contact Stephan Kulow &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/kiwi-users">coolo at suse.de</A>&gt;
for details why it does not work. As I said 11.4 is not out it also
could be a temmporary problem related to the distro development.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> pointed me to take a look into the include file which then pointed me to the 
</I>&gt;<i> CDDevice function in the same file. 
</I>&gt;<i> First of all I tried echo'ing out the devices which where found with CDDevice 
</I>&gt;<i> (line 2924 where the 'search for CD/DVD devices' part starts) because I 
</I>&gt;<i> guessed the script detected only the CD part of the U3 stick and not the usb 
</I>&gt;<i> drive itself somehow. (and no I don't have a cd/dvd drive, because its a 
</I>&gt;<i> netbook) And well it was exactly what I expected to see it mounted 12 times 
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/sr0 which is the cd part of the U3 stick and searched for the isoclient 
</I>&gt;<i> live configuration file which is obviously not on the U3s cd part. 
</I>&gt;<i> So I took a look at the CDDevice function in the include file and to my 
</I>&gt;<i> surprise I found that 'hwinfo --cdrom' is used to get the device name (i.e. 
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/sr0). So I changed that to '$h --block ...' and rebuild initrd replaced 
</I>&gt;<i> the one on the stick with my patched one and what can I say it boots
</I>&gt;<i> just fine 
</I>
Well if you looked into the include file then you also found:

  function CDMount {
       ...
       #======================================
       # walk through media
       #--------------------------------------
       if [ -z &quot;$kiwi_hybrid&quot; ];then
          # this is the non hybrid case, searching for CD/DVD
       else
          # this is the hybrid case, searching for a disk 
       fi

In your case which boots the iso as a disk the path searching for
a CD device never should have been entered. What kiwi does here is, it
calls the function searchBIOSBootDevice() which searches for a disk
and a special Master-Boot-Record ID written into the hybrid iso.
I have no clue and I also can't reproduce why it did not find it
in your case. In order to debug this I need the file

  /var/log/boot.kiwi

you can get that file if you boot with kiwidebug=1 and store it 
somewhere on the stick

&gt;<i> now without any error. (I attached a patch file which highlights
</I>&gt;<i> the changes for the devs) 
</I>
Problem with the patch is that it breaks the CDDevice() function.
This function intentionally searches for CD/DVD devices only. As I
said it shouldn't have been called at all in your case. 

&gt;<i> It might be also better as the current usb boot option (which I only saw in 
</I>&gt;<i> the code and didn't test out though) which somehow just like I understand it 
</I>&gt;<i> will check if there is space on the usb stick and will automatically create a 
</I>&gt;<i> cow (copy on write / overlay / persistent) image and uses it. Using this
</I>&gt;<i> slows down the experience of the live usb user as writing to some common
</I>&gt;<i> usb sticks is slow and especially its a somehow pain in the ass for every
</I>&gt;<i> netbook user who just only wants to test out if openSUSE runs on his
</I>&gt;<i> netbook and when it does install it.
</I>
The so called hybrid_persistent feature is an option which one can
turn on. By default we don't create a persistent cow space

Thanks for your report. It would be great if we can find out why it does
not boot on your side. So the boot.kiwi log file would be great and I'm
eager to understand if building the JeOS as I described it works for
you.

Thanks

Regards,
Marcus
