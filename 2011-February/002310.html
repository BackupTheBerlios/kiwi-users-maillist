I just rebuilt everything to be sure. The resizing takes much longer
compared to the EXT4 resize, which happened almost immediately. But this
seems not to fail now. So, one step forward.

After the resizing, the system makes some complaints about various
things not being writable. Unfortunately they zip off the screen before
I can see them all. They were things like:

 Could not get pty for fbset

or nfs. or any other things I guess it is starting.

I get an X login screen. But the keyboard and mouse are not working. So
I cannot get in to the system to see what is wrong. On other VTs I see
that the mouse and keyboard are detected. They are standard devices.

After this, I reboot the system. I get the grub menu with the install
listed as [oem]. I would have thought that would have gone away after
the image was loaded in the first step. Of course, I am unclear what is
expected to happen when in the preload scenario. That is what I am
hoping to see now...

I see some lines like:

/etc/initscript: I see /etc/init.d/boot: permission denied

That seems not good.

Once again I get the X login with no working keyboard or mouse.

Reboot again (power off/on...). I thought I would give a run level on
the grub menu command line. But it still says it is doing runlevel 5.
And I get the X screen teasing me.

Once again this is with the original example. The only change is I am
using ext3. And my 11.2 repo is a local DVD instead of the one on the
internet. I have built other kiwi images with that image, and the md5sum
is correct.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I get a bit confused about which spec is for the stick/iso, and which is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the target that will be installed on some new system. I would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; imagine that the spec above is for the stick, not the image that gets
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; copied. Or?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's for both. It means create the split OS image and also create
</I>&gt;<i> an installation stick image including that OS image
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have now tried the pristine original
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; examples/suse-11.2/suse-oem-preload. The result is exactly the same.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again I don't think this is an imaging issue. To me it looks like
</I>&gt;<i> a ext4 but in combination with resize2fs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have now let it run longer, and I see that the error messages do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; eventually stop. It is stopped asking for the runlevel. So obviously
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something has gone bad.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you see problems like the one above you can't rely on your
</I>&gt;<i> operating system anymore. All kinds of crap can happen if the
</I>&gt;<i> filesystem screws up. What you saw after the broken resize operation
</I>&gt;<i> are all after effects of the broken filesystem.
</I>&gt;<i>
