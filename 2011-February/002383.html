</I>&gt;<i> Hi Robert,
</I>&gt;<i> Hey thanks again for the help on this.  I realize that I'm a bit thick
</I>&gt;<i> headed. It's not intentional.  After writing the developer/package of
</I>&gt;<i> LXDE I'm a bit disappointed with the reply. (displayed at the end of
</I>&gt;<i> this message)
</I>&gt;<i> Due to this I'm going to try placing my LXDE-common-branding-SOS
</I>&gt;<i> packaged RPM file in the overlay tree of Kiwi.  I've read the tutorial
</I>&gt;<i> on the GFXBoot and Bootsplash package and who it was integrated into
</I>&gt;<i> the kiwi image.  This seems very similar but instead of the package
</I>&gt;<i> contents being tared the will be be installed as an RPM.
</I>&gt;<i> I included in my &quot;config.sh&quot; file the commands
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;rpm -e --nodeps lxde-common-branding-openSUSE-11.3-54.2.noarch&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;rpm -i lxde-common-branding-SOS-11.3-30.1.noarch&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A couple of questions.
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Does the RPM command have to be placed in a specific place within
</I>&gt;<i> the config.sh file?
</I>
Should be done prior to the call to the suseConfig call.

&gt;<i> 2) In the config.xml file I know I have to add a line or two.  Am I
</I>&gt;<i> adding an &lt;archive&gt; line? 
</I>
No, you are not, you are removing lines from config.xml. The files in
the overlay tree (under root) get included in the image automatically.

Note here, that there is one problem. If you are customizing the
background for the bootsplash and the grub menu you cannot use this
approach. There reason being that there is no way for you to get these
packages into the initrd which is where they need to be to customize the
bootsplash and grub menu.

&gt;<i> I assume that this line would be just for
</I>&gt;<i> the Tar archive only.
</I>&gt;<i> Currently kiwi is pulling this lxde-common-branding-SOS package from
</I>&gt;<i> my repo but now it's going to be installing from a local source. 
</I>
In this case you are doing the installation, Kiwi is out of the picture.
Kiwi just executed config.sh at the root level of the unpacked image
tree at the end of the prepare step.

&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> placed this RPM withing the overlay tree in /opt/branding/  How is
</I>&gt;<i> this done?
</I>
Not sure I understand the question but in your configuration tree you
should have

root/opt/branding/

this turns into /opt/branding/ when referencing it in config.sh

&gt;<i> 3) Do I also have to add the bootinclude=&quot;true&quot; string in the package line?
</I>
You cannot reference the packages in config.xml, see comment above about
the initrd problem.

&gt;<i> 4) If the Tar archive is to be used I would place the tar file in the
</I>&gt;<i> kiwi discription directory with the &quot;root&quot; overlay folder, config.xml
</I>&gt;<i> and config.sh files correct?
</I>
Yes the tarball is at the same level as config.xml etc. as documented.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm looking for a branding solution that will be consistent regardless
</I>&gt;<i> of what somebody else did in a spec file.  If including the said
</I>&gt;<i> branding package in RPM form works like this every time I would apt to
</I>&gt;<i> go with this method...or if the Tar archive is faster (I assume it
</I>&gt;<i> would be if the RPM isn't already made) then I would go in this
</I>&gt;<i> direction.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this particular circumstance I have already made the RPM for this
</I>&gt;<i> package but for the sake of using one method (for now) should I just
</I>&gt;<i> download the source files from my RPM and tarball the contents.  It
</I>&gt;<i> seems like the end results is the same...and the config.sh file
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't need to be tweaked as the RPMs wouldn't be used at all.
</I>
This sounds like you still have conceptual difficulties, however, I am
not sure how to explain things differently than they are documented.

- If you use you RPM branding packages, the only way to get them into
the image is via overlay tree and then installing the packages yourself
via config.sh. There is no way to change the bootsplash and grub menu
this way as the packages will NOT end up in the initrd

- If you use a tarball use &lt;archive ....bootinclude=&quot;true&quot;/&gt; in
config.xml, follow the documented example.

HTH,
Robert
