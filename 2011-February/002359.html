</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Chris,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I hope I'm posting this correctly. I'm not sure if the all the post
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from the buildservice ML made it over to the kiwi ML.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Let me try an break down where I am so far and give as much info as I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can regarding packages.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The technique that I used to make all of my branding packages was this.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1) I first download the source files from the openSUSE11.3 project of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the particular branding package that I want in OBS.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2) I then make a copy on my local machine of that branding package.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3) I go though the config files, spec file, tar, and image and replace
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and update everything to what I need it to be.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 4) I then repackage it create a new package in my OBS account and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> upload the contents of the source and have OBS build the package.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I've had many issue with builds but I'm sure they were a lack of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> experience on my part.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 5) I then update my config.xml file locally so that Kiwi can pull that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> package in from my repo.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I do remember the link that (I think it was Marcus) posted (
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:KIWI_Cookbook_Splash_Screen#Custom_GRUB_and_boot_splash_images">http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:KIWI_Cookbook_Splash_Screen#Custom_GRUB_and_boot_splash_images</A>).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;I know for sure that I did go though MOST of that page but I'm also
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sure that I ended up using OpenPC version of GFXBOOT and BootSplash to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fill in the blanks...BIG mistake as OpenPC has Javier. He has some
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> experience and kind of did things his own way. &#160;I think his way works
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> very well but I need to build a foundation for my methods and his way
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is over my head right now.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Now regarding the question &quot;&quot;where do your package install the files&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;Well since my branding package such as GFXBOOT and Bootsplash are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> based on SUSE versions they are where the SUSE branding package would
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be EXCEPT that my projects name is the folder for the theme not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;openSUSE&quot; or &quot;SUSE&quot;. &#160;So this project name right now is SOS. &#160;So all
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of my themes are all in the SOS theme folder. &#160;The rule of thumb on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this is that EVERYTHING in the whatever branding package that we are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> talking about that was named/labeled &quot;openSUSE&quot; is now named &quot;SOS&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So I don't think there is a problem with the package itself...although
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I remember about a month ago I had a similar issue with my GFXBOOT
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> package. &#160;Same conflict. &#160;I can't remember who helped me with that but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I do remember having to tweak the spec file of this package and remove
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> some &quot;openSUSE&quot; stuff and I think we removed the &quot;conflicts&quot; string on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> one of the subpackages. &#160;I'm sure this issue is my fault I just don't
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> know where the faults is.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Please, post the error message. Without it we will be guessing forever
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> more. Playing a guessing game looses it's appeal at some point as there
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is little satisfaction after a while.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I ran the command &quot;kiwi --info /path/to/image/description --select
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> packages&quot;. &#160; This command looks like it shows EVERY package that is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> being installed. &#160;Including the ones in the patterns. Is this correct?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yes
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; I can clearly see both the &quot;lxde-common-branding-SOS&quot; and the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;lxde-common-branding-openSUSE&quot; package visible.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Looking at the LONG list of packages that shows up when running &#160;this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> command seems like it's crazy to manually enter the package separately
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and remove the patterens. &#160;Correct?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yes
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;Learning what is causing this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> package conflict is the key to this issue...and to avoid many more
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> like it as I have lots of other branded packages to replace, such as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Suse.release and others like it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For this project I always was trying to do my rebrands all the way.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Not using the existing SUSE dir and files to hold my images and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> configs with the openSUSE name. &#160;I thought by taking the original
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> source and changing everything that this issue wouldn't exist because
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the packages have their own direct and configs.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The answer to the question &quot;What is the oem branding package ?&quot; &#160;By
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> OEM I mean the our branded packages. &#160;Original Equipment Manufacturer.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe the best way to get to the problem is if you guys could take a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> look at my spec file for this lxde-common-branding-SOS package,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Seeing the actual error message would certainly help to speed things up.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In general, while Marcus and I are more than happy to help, as are other
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> users on this list, it is much easier for us to help if we have an error
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> message to work with.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Statements such as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> package A conflicts with package B
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are not very useful to us for providing good answers.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> config.xml file that kiwi is using to make the image and anything else
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that you can think of that will confirm one way or another what the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> issue is. &#160;The more I do the more I know what isn't or is correct. &#160;I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> just don't have enough of &quot;correct&quot; to know what I'm doing yet.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This SOS project is &#160;subproject of another project of mine...if that matters.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The link to the lxde-common-branding-SOS branding package is here
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://build.opensuse.org/project/packages?package=&amp;project=home%3Aeportel6607%3ASOS">https://build.opensuse.org/project/packages?package=&amp;project=home%3Aeportel6607%3ASOS</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You have the conflict built right into your spec file:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Provides: &#160; &#160; &#160; lxde-common-branding = %{version}
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Conflicts: &#160; &#160; &#160;otherproviders(lxde-common-branding)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I bet the project provided LXDE branding package also provides
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> lxde-common-branding, and since your spec explicitly declares these two
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in conflict there is no away around the problem from a package manager
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> perspective.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ok I apologize for the lack of info. &#160; I'm so caught up in learning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this and kind of overwhelmed with making sure that I truly understand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what is 'the fix' and 'what is the problem' that I lost sight of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> basics...posting the error.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The error in the terminal when running kiwi --prepare is this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Problem: lxde-common-branding-SOS-11.3-29.1.noarch conflicts with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> namespace:otherproviders(lxde-common-branding) provided by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lxde-common-branding-openSUSE-11.3-54.2.noarch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;Solution 1: deinstallation of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lxde-common-branding-openSUSE-11.3-54.2.noarch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;Solution 2: do not install lxde-common-branding-SOS-11.3-29.1.noarch
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So this error points directly at the &quot;Conflicts&quot; line in your spec file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I didn't think that the line in the spec file &quot;Conflicts:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> otherproviders(lxde-common-branding)&quot; was a problem because I thought
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there can only be one version of a package installed. &#160;Also there is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> line in that spec file that points to a Suse package called
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;desktop-data-openSUSE&quot;. This is still pointing to this package
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because I haven't made the SOS equivalent for it. &#160; As a reminder, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> didn't make this spec file up from scratch this it the default Suse
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spec file for this package just modified for my branding themes. &#160;I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thought if it worked for Suse it should work for me too. &#160;WRONG.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ahhhh Ok I commented out the Conflicts line in the spec file and now I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> got the opposite packages conflicting. &#160;The new error reads&quot; Problem:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lxde-common-branding-openSUSE-11.3-54.2.noarch conflicts with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> namespace:otherproviders(lxde-common-branding) provided by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lxde-common-branding-SOS-11.3-30.1.noarch
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This means the lxde-common-branding-openSUSE spec file also has a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Conflicts&quot; line in it. You can try to get the maintainer of the
</I>&gt;<i> lxde-common-branding-openSUSE-11.3 package to remove the &quot;Conflicts&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> line from the spec file to allow multiple packages to provide the
</I>&gt;<i> lxde-common-branding requirement. If the maintainer is not willing to do
</I>&gt;<i> this you're out of luck and will have to do your branding using the
</I>&gt;<i> tarball method as described in the example (link previously posted).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;Solution 1: deinstallation of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lxde-common-branding-openSUSE-11.3-54.2.noarch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;Solution 2: do not install lxde-common-branding-SOS-11.3-30.1.noarch &#160;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have the suse package in the delete section and my config.sh file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and have &quot;suseRemovePackagesMarkedForDeletion&quot; string under the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Functions&quot; section. &#160;I'm am sooo lost. &#160;Should I try the &quot;replaces&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> again in my config.xml file?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is nothing Kiwi can do to resolve this conflict as the problem
</I>&gt;<i> occurs when the package manager (zypper) tries to create a self
</I>&gt;<i> consistent set of packages to install. The problem is the &quot;Conflicts&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> specification in both spec files. IMHO there is no reason to have this,
</I>&gt;<i> but I am not the maintainer of LXDE, you'll have to convince her/him.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The option 1 method seems very similar to the way I did branding in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the past with my other base project (PCLOS and Unity). &#160;Correct if I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wrong but doesn't this method leave you in a situation that if the OS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was to do an Update, any package(s) that were updated that regarding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> branding would overwrite your branding packages?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, the &quot;Provides&quot; specification in the spec file tells the package
</I>&gt;<i> management system what dependency is satisfied by this package.
</I>&gt;<i> Somewhere in an LXDE package spec file you will be able to find a
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Requires: lxde-common-branding
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This requirement will then (in a situation without your branding
</I>&gt;<i> package) pull in the lxde-common-branding-openSUSE-11.3-54.2.noarch
</I>&gt;<i> package. Now, with the current spec file setup to get your branding onto
</I>&gt;<i> a system one would have to run the following commands:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # rpm -e --nodeps lxde-common-branding-openSUSE-11.3-54.2.noarch
</I>&gt;<i> # rpm -i lxde-common-branding-SOS-11.3-30.1.noarch
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now the system would be consistent as both packages provide the
</I>&gt;<i> lxde-common-branding requirement. During an update process the
</I>&gt;<i> lxde-common-branding-openSUSE-11.3-54.2.noarch would not be updated as
</I>&gt;<i> it is not installed in the first place. Remember the dependency is on
</I>&gt;<i> ANY package that provides the lxde-common-branding dependency, which
</I>&gt;<i> after the rpm commands above would be your package.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now back to the image build. Kiwi cannot do this for you. At the time
</I>&gt;<i> packages get installed Kiwi is out of the picture and the package
</I>&gt;<i> manager has full control. If there is a conflict it will complain and
</I>&gt;<i> subsequently exit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I need to do this in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a way that it works as if it's the default package. Therefore updating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the correct branding package. &#160;Basiclly I think it needs to work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the way that Suse packages work with each other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would, with the exception that in the current arrangement there is no
</I>&gt;<i> way for you to get your package into the image if you continue to use
</I>&gt;<i> the LXDE pattern.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not lazy that's for sure so I could do option 3 however I don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think under these circumstances that it make sense to do it that way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because the list of packages that I don't want is far smaller than the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> package I do want.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, you have to consider how often you will be updating the branding
</I>&gt;<i> package. Using the tarball method (option 1) may just be the ticket. You
</I>&gt;<i> can then leave the project provided package in place, but it will not be
</I>&gt;<i> used, other than satisfying a dependency in the RPM DB.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course you still have the option of convincing the maintained of the
</I>&gt;<i> LXDE project package to remove the &quot;Conflicts&quot; setting in the spec file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess there are many ways to approach resolving a problem like this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;Right now I need to know one way and fully understand why I'm doing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it this/that way. &#160;THEN I can apply that knowledge to other methods.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My goal is to make sure whatever I do to solve an issue is not going
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to bite me in the butt 3 months from now and then have to rethink and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> redo it all over again. That's happen before.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In terms of the &quot;ignore&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; elements. &#160;First is there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something wrong with the &quot;ignore&quot; element?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is it working the way that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it should?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It works the best it can. We cannot ignore packages that are part of a
</I>&gt;<i> pattern in Kiwi since we do not inspect the package list represented by
</I>&gt;<i> the named pattern.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm thinking that it was working fine it's just my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> circumstances.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You mentioned that the &quot;delete&quot; element can be used if I choose to use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> method 2 to delete the unwanted packages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but only if you could install your package in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i> However, at this point you cannot do to the &quot;Conflicts&quot; setting in the
</I>&gt;<i> spec files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But this deletes the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> packages when exactly...before Kiwi makes the final ISO, during the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completion of the &quot;unpacked&quot; image (at the end of the Kiwi --prepare&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stage) or upon the install or live boot of the ISO itself?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Towards the of the prepare step. Packages first get installed into the
</I>&gt;<i> unpacked tree, then any packages marked for delete get deleted later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So is the method that I'm using to make branded package acceptable or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> am I asking for problems?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is perfectly acceptable. However, as you are experiencing you are
</I>&gt;<i> also at the mercy of others. In this case you can see that the
</I>&gt;<i> maintainer of the LXDE package wants to be the only one supplying the
</I>&gt;<i> lxde-common-branding requirement. Thus you now have to negotiate with
</I>&gt;<i> that person. If you do branding using the tarball method you are not
</I>&gt;<i> dependent on other people, live is easier from an install point of view.
</I>&gt;<i> But from an update point of view on a running image the tarball method
</I>&gt;<i> is of course not so nice as it operates outside of the package manager.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I naturally thought taking the original
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> branded package from openSUSE11.3 would be a good starting point.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have many more branding packages to create. &#160;To find out all the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> branding package within this LXDE project should I run the rpm -q
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> command and then download the orignal default branding package and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then do what I've been doing so far. &#160;That is copy package and rebrand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everything, spec, images, configs then repackage it and have OBS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rebuild it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you will need to have a converstation with the LXDE maintainer.
</I>&gt;<i> This is way outside of the Kiwi and even regular packaging scope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is one more option you have at your disposal. You can put your
</I>&gt;<i> branding package into the overlay tree for example in /opt/mypackages.
</I>&gt;<i> Then in config.sh you can insert the rpm commands shown above. This will
</I>&gt;<i> leave you with a consistent system. But more maintenance of your Kiwi
</I>&gt;<i> config tree as you will not be able to get the latest version of your
</I>&gt;<i> branding packages via the config.xml file. This is now a manual step.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>Hi guys,
I emailed the LXDE maintainer about this issue but still haven't herd
back from him yet.
I'm trying so hard to understand and get the flow of all this but so
far nothing has gone smoothly enough for me to get comfortable with
anything.  We talked about getting the contents of this package and
using the Tar method to installing it and I assume that it would also
work using the Overlay file method, both would be a problem if the
package manager updated these file.  I would think the results would
be that my branding (at least the branding that was installed by one
of these two methods) would be overwritten with the default Suse
version.

Will mentioned that since I have the RPM package for this branding
package that it could be used in a similar way to Tar file method but
that I wouldn't get overwritten by the package manager during an
update.  He had a meeting to go to so that's all I have on this.  Does
he mean that the RPM can be &quot;tar-ed&quot; and is installed like a tar
file??  I checked the kiwi PDF docs and can't find anything on this.

Can the RPM be &quot;forced&quot; in?

There are sooo many questions I have regarding this sort of stuff.
When it comes to branding/re-branding that I'm at the mercy of whoever
packaged the originals Suse packages.

Is there a way that if I built all the branding package that these
RPMs can be installed in to the image without the &quot;overwrite&quot; issues?
I would think that if the RPMs are of the branding packages are used
that the PM would &quot;know&quot; that they are there as compared to the tar
and overlay method the PM wouldn't know the branding packages were
there.  I guess it would be the difference between managed and
unmanaged package installations.

If this is possible I assume the config.xml file would have to be
tweaked to have the repos section allow for local installs of the
RPMs?
Would the &quot;image.sh&quot; script have to actually install the RPMs?

Thanks guys. You guys have helped me more in the last 3 days than I&quot;ve
received in the last 3 months with IRC.
Chris
