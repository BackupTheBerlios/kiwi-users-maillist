&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi guys,
</I>&gt;<i> I emailed the LXDE maintainer about this issue but still haven't herd
</I>&gt;<i> back from him yet.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying so hard to understand and get the flow of all this but so
</I>&gt;<i> far nothing has gone smoothly enough for me to get comfortable with
</I>&gt;<i> anything.  We talked about getting the contents of this package and
</I>&gt;<i> using the Tar method to installing it and I assume that it would also
</I>&gt;<i> work using the Overlay file method, 
</I>
No, it will not work using the overlay method. Some of the branding
stuff needs to be in the initrd and this can only be accomplished via a
package or archive, you need to use the bootinclude=&quot;true&quot; attribute
setting.

&gt;<i> both would be a problem if the
</I>&gt;<i> package manager updated these file. 
</I>
How can the package manager update &quot;these files&quot; when according to your
earlier comment you placed all your branding into directories that are
unique to your branding strategy?

The only thing that could happen is that an update overwrites the
configuration file that points to your branding. IN that case you are
dealing with a zypper bug.

&gt;<i> I would think the results would
</I>&gt;<i> be that my branding (at least the branding that was installed by one
</I>&gt;<i> of these two methods) would be overwritten with the default Suse
</I>&gt;<i> version.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Will mentioned that since I have the RPM package for this branding
</I>&gt;<i> package that it could be used in a similar way to Tar file method but
</I>&gt;<i> that I wouldn't get overwritten by the package manager during an
</I>&gt;<i> update.  He had a meeting to go to so that's all I have on this.  Does
</I>&gt;<i> he mean that the RPM can be &quot;tar-ed&quot; and is installed like a tar
</I>&gt;<i> file?? 
</I>
Sorry, I do not know what you mean. Since you appear to struggle with
this concept, have you tried to built the Kiwi example that shows how to
brand the bootmenu and splash screen? If not, you should follow this, it
might clarify many of the things you appear to have troubles with.

&gt;<i> I checked the kiwi PDF docs and can't find anything on this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can the RPM be &quot;forced&quot; in?
</I>
No, Kiwi has no way to interact with the package manager other than
saying &quot;go install this stuff&quot;.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are sooo many questions I have regarding this sort of stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> When it comes to branding/re-branding that I'm at the mercy of whoever
</I>&gt;<i> packaged the originals Suse packages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a way that if I built all the branding package that these
</I>&gt;<i> RPMs can be installed in to the image without the &quot;overwrite&quot; issues?
</I>
See my previous message about putting the rpms in the overlay tree and
then using config.sh to get the packages installed.

&gt;<i> I would think that if the RPMs are of the branding packages are used
</I>&gt;<i> that the PM would &quot;know&quot; that they are there as compared to the tar
</I>&gt;<i> and overlay method the PM wouldn't know the branding packages were
</I>&gt;<i> there.  I guess it would be the difference between managed and
</I>&gt;<i> unmanaged package installations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If this is possible I assume the config.xml file would have to be
</I>&gt;<i> tweaked to have the repos section allow for local installs of the
</I>&gt;<i> RPMs?
</I>&gt;<i> Would the &quot;image.sh&quot; script have to actually install the RPMs?
</I>
See above and previous mail in this thread. It does help to read the
answers we provide ;)

Later,
Robert
