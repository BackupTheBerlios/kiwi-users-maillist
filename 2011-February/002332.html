<PRE>Hi Chris,

&gt;<i> &gt; None of the last few suggestions have worked.  I'm a bit confused on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this issue.  Isn't this rebrand situation one of the more common uses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for Kiwi?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe yes, but I do not know. For re-branding people may not necessarily
</I>&gt;<i> create their own packages, but rather use the method documented here:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:KIWI_Cookbook_Splash_Screen#Custom_GRUB_and_boot_splash_images">http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:KIWI_Cookbook_Splash_Screen#Custom_GRUB_and_boot_splash_images</A>
</I>
People want custom branding, yes but most of them rebrand by just
overwriting data as described in the article Robert posted. Even though
it is much more clean to create a branding package one needs to take
care for some branding package specific 'rules' which I will write
down later in this mail

&gt;<i> Thus, there are no packaging conflicts. Further the branding packages
</I>&gt;<i> are generally separate as in
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> bootsplash-branding-openSUSE
</I>&gt;<i> gfxboot-branding-openSUSE
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> rather than being part of a pattern. You are running into trouble
</I>&gt;<i> because the definition of the LXDE pattern includes the branding packages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These branding packages for some reason or another cause a conflict.
</I>&gt;<i> However, that there is a conflict sounds fishy to begin with. I suspect
</I>&gt;<i> that your branding packages are putting files in the same location as
</I>&gt;<i> the distribution supplied packages and that's why the conflict is
</I>&gt;<i> triggered. Different branding packages should put their files into
</I>&gt;<i> different directories, then there is no opportunity for conflicts.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I am going on a &quot;clean up the world&quot; tangent now and will stop.
</I>
It's perfectly fine to have multiple branding packages installed
_but_ each of them have to provide an own theme name. Example:

  a)
  bootsplash-branding-openSUSE
     ==&gt; installs to: /etc/bootsplash/themes/openSUSE 
  Theme Name: openSUSE
     ==&gt; in kiwi config.xml &lt;boot-theme&gt;openSUSE&lt;/boot-theme&gt;

  b)
  bootsplash-branding-SLES
    ==&gt; install to: /etc/bootsplash/themes/SLES
  Theme Name: SLES
    ==&gt; in kiwi config.xml &lt;boot-theme&gt;SLES&lt;/boot-theme&gt;

  c)
  Your branding package
    ==&gt; install to: /etc/bootsplash/themes/YourBranding
  Theme Name: YourBranding
    ==&gt; in kiwi config.xml &lt;boot-theme&gt;YourBranding&lt;/boot-theme&gt;

If your branding package follow these rules there will be no
conflict and you can easily use it by just selecting the theme
in &lt;boot-theme&gt;

So the question I have is: where do your package install
the files 

   rpm -qpl &quot;Your branding package&quot;

&gt;<i> &gt; I would have thought that replacing a default SUSE package
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with and OEM branding package would be fairly common, no?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Probably, as mentioned above the packages are separate by default and
</I>&gt;<i> thus in the &quot;common&quot; case one just does not install the openSUSE
</I>&gt;<i> branding packages. The problem is the pattern.
</I>
What is the oem branding package ?

&gt;<i> &gt; What I am very surprised with is that the &quot;replaces&quot; element added to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the package line doesn't work either.  That was really disappointing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I thought for sure this would work.  The other thing that makes no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sense is how clearly the kiwi docs .pdf file states that if this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem exists...then use the &quot;ignore&quot; element to resolve it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will take a look at the doc and re-word it to make this less
</I>&gt;<i> ambiguous. I'll submit a patch for this.
</I>
I will add that patch today. 'replaces', replaces one ore more packages
with another package but this doesn't have any impact on the previos
package dependency and conflict creation of the package manager. If
you put a branding package into your package list which conflicts
with another package this conflict always will be reported because
the very first and prio1 task is to make sure that the specified package
list is conflict free. replaces and delete happens after the packagemanager
thought about the package list. I can't change this because the
packagemanager backend (zypper in our case) always wants a clean
list which it didn't get and so it errors out.

The ignore statement is processed before the package list is passed to
the package manager but as I said in case of patterns we leave it up to
the package manager to solve them and so the ignore doesn't have an impact
on the contents of patterns if zypper is used

&gt;<i> &gt; So does this mean that I now have to add each package that each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pattern contains and leave out the ones that are being replaced by our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OEM packages?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, and no. You can take the approach of basically expanding the list
</I>&gt;<i> of packages that are part of the pattern in the config.xml file.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the root cause is really not the use of the pattern but rather
</I>&gt;<i> the packages that cause the conflict. If I were in your shoes I would
</I>&gt;<i> work on understanding why the packages conflict and then fix the
</I>&gt;<i> conflicts, I know back to &quot;clean up the world&quot; mode.
</I>
I completely agree, solve the package conflict

&gt;<i> &gt; If so how can we confirm EXACTLY what packages are contained in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pattern package? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Information about patterns are found in suse/setup/descr/ on the media.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not know where the source of the patterns resides, probably
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere in the buildservice.
</I>
You can let kiwi solve the list for you:

  kiwi --info /path/to/image/description --select packages

it will print the list of solved packages. This also requires that
the specified package list is conflict free. If there is a conflict,
the conflict will be reported.

But again I strongly recommend to fix the package causing the
conflict. We are not talking about a kiwi bug or inconvenience
that's all cause by a packaging problem. By the way I didn't
receive the exact error message you got from the package manager.
I would be glad to assist in solving the issue here on the list
This will also help others

Regards,
Marcus
