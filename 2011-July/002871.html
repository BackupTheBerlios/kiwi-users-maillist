<PRE>Hi Daniel,

&gt;<i> A bit of a delay as there were a couple of things I had to identify but
</I>&gt;<i> it's all working now. It's a long story so I'll try to keep it as concise
</I>&gt;<i> as possible.
</I>
wow I'm impressed. Before I start to comment on your report I'd like to
tell that I have tried to import all your changes as a patch to kiwi
which is attached to this mail. The patch includes:

* make dmraid utility part of the initrd (oemboot and netboot)
* add fake raid device detection code in probeDevices()
* use option --listmd in hwinfo to show dmraid devices
* add device mapper name resolution in function ddn()
* add fallback code for DHCP network. if PXE_IFACE from the
  pxeboot does not work, walk through the list and try to setup
  the interface
  
Unfortunately I don't have such a controller so I can't test this
It would be really great if you can give this a test again

&gt;<i> 7. Other things to note: 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a) the fake raid controller will not properly overwrite data on the disk when writing out the OEM file downloaded from the server. I think this may have been the cause of the busybox problem I was mentioning before. I think whenever I was using TFTP to download the image, I was not working from a clean disk. For some reason, the write fails and an exception is raised, crashing the install.
</I>
Don't think I can do much here :( So ftp or http backend can be used via
kiwiserver and kiwiservertype as you already know

&gt;<i> b) insufficient memory does not seem to cause the download checks to fail.
</I>&gt;<i> At all times, the download image is checked as fine, but the system of course
</I>&gt;<i> crashes shortly afterwards - where depending on just how much it was able
</I>&gt;<i> to download before it ran out of memory. 
</I>
What kind of memory do you mean ? disk space or RAM ? the /var/log/boot.kiwi
file helps here to identify how it checks the size. Normally it should
print &quot;Not enough space available for this image&quot; if the disk space is not
big enough to store the image

&gt;<i> So the final questions I have are:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Any idea why the dmraid package is not getting included in the boot initrd?
</I>
yes suseStripInitrd() did not know about it, see my patch

&gt;<i> 2. Does it seem feasible that the above changes can somehow be incorporated
</I>&gt;<i> into KIWI and/or am I missing something in my config? 
</I>
I have tried to address everything you wrote in the attached patch.
I really would like to include it if we don't break other stuff. So
far I think this should be possible

&gt;<i> Anyway, I hope all that makes sense. Let me know if you've got any
</I>&gt;<i> more questions or suggestions. Thanks for your feedback in helping me
</I>&gt;<i> go down this path. I now know more than I ever expected (or wanted to)
</I>&gt;<i> about the Linux internals! 
</I>
That was great work, let's include it :)

Regards,
Marcus
