<PRE>Hi, 

&gt;<i> For one of the pilot-projects around here, they build a bootable encrypted USB-stick, just containing Gnome-desktop, LUKS, OpenSC, NX-client, ICA-client, openvpn, Linphone and some small stuff. Allthough i pointed them to kiwi, they decided in their infinite wisdom to do everything with Ubuntu and create some spagetty-code to create the images.....
</I>
This happens quite often unfortunately. Even though I work for SuSE
and I'm pro SuSE I'm also pro other distros and I really appreciate
contributions from other distributions. My time does not permit to
go around for promotion, negotiations and talks to the right people
at RH, Debian, Ubuntu and others which is most likely the cause for
less trust or the easier solution to do everything themselves. The
design of kiwi at least does not lock out others and is intentionally
open for all distributions. The idea behind that was to let distro
experts contribute the differences and share all the common parts.
I think it's still a long way to get there but I'm confident to
convince people for a more clean solution as soon as the &quot;spagetty-code&quot;
strikes back in terms of maintenance and bugs :) 

&gt;<i> Currently they find out that a lot of drievers for the latest
</I>&gt;<i> USB-wifi-dongels are not present in the default ubuntu repo.
</I>
Were you able to find those drivers in other distro kernel packages ?

&gt;<i> As long as the pilot runs, i've got the possibility to present another
</I>&gt;<i> option: - either let them continue, with U-11.04 (with the problems
</I>&gt;<i> with Unity etc etc)
</I>&gt;<i> - OpenSuSE_11.4 default
</I>&gt;<i> - OpenSuSE_11.4 with kernel-of-the-day
</I>&gt;<i> - OpenSuSE_Tumbleweed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, if maximum number of drivers (VGA, wifi) is the goal, 
</I>&gt;<i> which option gets me the best results?
</I>
- If you have the drivers packaged no matter if they are part of one
  of the distro kernels or as a distro kernel-module-package (kmp)
  it would be easy to add and maintain them using a kiwi image
  description.

- If you only have access to the code but no one has ever packaged
  it and that kernel source is somewhere in an orphaned tree at the
  distro side it is hard for kiwi to use that kernel 

&gt;<i> At least Greg-KH works fulltime at kernels at SuSE. From Ubuntu i've
</I>&gt;<i> heard that they obain most of their kernelpatches from other distro's,
</I>&gt;<i> so i really wonder how fast they can produce new drivers...
</I>
I can't tell about Ubuntus effort in creating the distro kernel, because
I don't know the process there. If you are right and they update from
what others do I think one of the distros which actively takes part in the
kernel development is more flexible But:

* convincing the kernel people to include a driver is a technical and
  most often political decision which needs time and flair ;)

* if the driver doesn't scratch an itch and has no business relation
  it might be even harder to get that thing into the kernel
  
&gt;<i> I'm looking for an un-biased suggestion. (Obviously any
</I>&gt;<i> SuSE-versions integrates best with kiwi, but I am allready pro-SuSE )
</I>
Well I think you should ask yourself the following questions:

- Does the distro provide an imaging toolkit like kiwi ?

- Does the distro provide all the software you need in the image
  or are there external repositories providing the software for
  that distro ?

- Does the distro kernel package include all drivers or are
  there external kmp drivers for that distro kernel available ?

- Is all the software including the kernel in a maintained area
  or is there the risk of a single point of failure somewhere in
  the process ?

Does this make sense ?

Regards,
Marcus
