<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Yes, it is difficult to track problems with the initrd. However,
</I>&gt;<i> this difficulty does not go away with the removal of the current
</I>&gt;<i> option. For the most common case, i.e. let kiwi create the initrd
</I>&gt;<i> nothing changes either.
</I>
What goes away would be the inconsistency between the setup in
the system image description and the used initrd. But from what
I have read so far people like that they can inject any kind of
prebuilt initrd even if it lacks required information.

So for those who know exactly what they do I agree it's still
nice to have this. With kiwi building the initrd the user get
rid of maintaining it which is what I thought most users want.
With prebuilt versions of an initrd the user has to maintain
both the system image and the initrd and he has to know when
he has to rebuilt it and what data needs to be included to
meet the system image requirements.

If that's acceptable as a &quot;power feature&quot; and not seen as wrong
design I'm fine with keeping it :) 

me personally think it's a wrong design and the intention of
prebuilt initrd's was to make image building more performant
not to allow users to inject any kind of initrd. For better
performance we have image caches in place now and I had planned
to allow recycle-root for boot images too.

But this is an open project and I'm not going to remove
a feature if people like it. The funny part is that I think
we use the feature in a way which it never was intended for :)

Thanks for the feedback

Regards,
Marcus
