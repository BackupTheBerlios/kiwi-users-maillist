<PRE>Hi Marcus,

I applied the patch and there were a couple of issues. The DHCP code worked perfectly, 
but the dmraid code changes didn't quite:

1. The line 'dmraid -a -y -p' in KIWILinuxRC.sh should not have a '-' before the 'y'. 
That is, it should read:

	dmraid -a y -p

2. Oddly, with the dmraid additions to probeDevices, the device was actually found by 

	hwinfo --disk --listmd

but the device name is /dev/dm-0 instead of /dev/mapper/lsi... 
What's interesting about that is that the 'function ddn' changes I did
earlier don't work, and, furthermore, I'm not entirely sure how they 
should be changed as I don't know the full naming conventions of the dmraid
device. In this particular example, the raw device is /dev/dm-0 and the first
partition is /dev/dm-1. That seems straightforward enough but if this was 
installed on a machine that had two raid devices, I have no idea what they
would be labelled. For now, I added the following to ddn and it did the job:

	if echo $1 | grep -q &quot;^\/dev\/dm-&quot; ; then 
		echo &quot;/dev/dm-&quot;$2 
		return 
	fi 

Maybe if you have more details on what multiple devices can be called, you'll
have a better idea of what 'ddn' should look like.

Anyway, thanks for the quick turnaround on the patches! Much appreciated. I'm
very happy now! :)

Daniel.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> wow I'm impressed. Before I start to comment on your report I'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> tell that I have tried to import all your changes as a patch to kiwi
</I>&gt;<i> which is attached to this mail. The patch includes:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * make dmraid utility part of the initrd (oemboot and netboot)
</I>&gt;<i> * add fake raid device detection code in probeDevices()
</I>&gt;<i> * use option --listmd in hwinfo to show dmraid devices
</I>&gt;<i> * add device mapper name resolution in function ddn()
</I>&gt;<i> * add fallback code for DHCP network. if PXE_IFACE from the
</I>&gt;<i>  pxeboot does not work, walk through the list and try to setup
</I>&gt;<i>  the interface
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately I don't have such a controller so I can't test this
</I>&gt;<i> It would be really great if you can give this a test again
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 7. Other things to note: 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a) the fake raid controller will not properly overwrite data on the disk when writing out the OEM file downloaded from the server. I think this may have been the cause of the busybox problem I was mentioning before. I think whenever I was using TFTP to download the image, I was not working from a clean disk. For some reason, the write fails and an exception is raised, crashing the install.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't think I can do much here :( So ftp or http backend can be used via
</I>&gt;<i> kiwiserver and kiwiservertype as you already know
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> b) insufficient memory does not seem to cause the download checks to fail.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At all times, the download image is checked as fine, but the system of course
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crashes shortly afterwards - where depending on just how much it was able
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to download before it ran out of memory. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What kind of memory do you mean ? disk space or RAM ? the /var/log/boot.kiwi
</I>&gt;<i> file helps here to identify how it checks the size. Normally it should
</I>&gt;<i> print &quot;Not enough space available for this image&quot; if the disk space is not
</I>&gt;<i> big enough to store the image
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So the final questions I have are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Any idea why the dmraid package is not getting included in the boot initrd?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> yes suseStripInitrd() did not know about it, see my patch
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Does it seem feasible that the above changes can somehow be incorporated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into KIWI and/or am I missing something in my config? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have tried to address everything you wrote in the attached patch.
</I>&gt;<i> I really would like to include it if we don't break other stuff. So
</I>&gt;<i> far I think this should be possible
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, I hope all that makes sense. Let me know if you've got any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more questions or suggestions. Thanks for your feedback in helping me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> go down this path. I now know more than I ever expected (or wanted to)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about the Linux internals! 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That was great work, let's include it :)
