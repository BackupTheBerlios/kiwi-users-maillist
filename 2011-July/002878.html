Yes, it is difficult to track problems with the initrd. However, this 
difficulty does not go away with the removal of the current option. For 
the most common case, i.e. let kiwi create the initrd nothing changes 
either.

</I>
Well, the basic underlying assumption with this is that kiwi created the 
initrd. What if I do not use kiwi to create the initrd?

I am making an argument for a use case that is outside of &quot;mainstream&quot; 
use of kiwi, that is correct. But we have other features that fit that 
description.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am not opposed to the idea, just not sure why we would need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> remove the existing option in this case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't like to deal with the potential risk of that feature.
</I>&gt;<i> I think it requests a lot knowledge from our users about the
</I>&gt;<i> internal processes running in kiwi when dealing with the boot
</I>&gt;<i> image. That's not user friendly
</I>
Well, user friendliness is in the eye of the beholder. If I cannot use 
my own initrd anymore that's not necessarily user friendly either ;).

Don't get me wrong, I am not married to this feature, and I am with you 
in not wanting to spend time debugging other people's initrd problems. 
However, there are valid use cases for this feature as an &quot;advanced user 
feature&quot;. Speak, use it and you're on your own.

&gt;<i> and I think kiwi should just
</I>&gt;<i> do the right thing.
</I>
Yes, kiwi should just do the right thing, we need to work on that ;) but 
that's another thread.

&gt;<i> Even me stumbles over that from time to time
</I>&gt;<i> when I forgot that I have added something in my system image which
</I>&gt;<i> requires a rebuild of the boot image, but the system insists to
</I>&gt;<i> use the static prebuilt version
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's why I think it should go away
</I>
I like the feature as a &quot;use at your own risk&quot; feature, but if no one 
else on this list chimes in and really cares to keep the feature than 
yes, lets get rid of it as the feature is apparently not being used.

Later,
Robert
