<PRE>Hi Daniel,

&gt;<i> I'm trying to build a KIWI configuration that takes advantage of the
</I>&gt;<i> RAID controller, or at the very least, creates a RAID partition,
</I>&gt;<i> instead of using the underlying drives. I can't seem to find a way
</I>&gt;<i> to do this. 
</I>
The RAID feature kiwi supports is the software raid stack of the kernel
If you have a machine with a hardware raid controller on board it's
important that the kiwi initrd includes the kernel driver for that
controller.

Along with the software raid feature there are some
restrictions at the moment:

1) only raid1 (mirroring) support
2) the RAID setup as described in the pxe image chapter in the kiwi
   documentation works with the pxe image type only. You can't use
   that together with an oem image deployed via pxe. I will explain
   why later in that mail

&gt;<i> The machines that are being used for this are rather old so I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> sure whether the RAID configuration that gets built with the default
</I>&gt;<i> openSUSE 11.4 network build is software or hardware, and the following
</I>&gt;<i> is the resulting /etc/fstab that installation process yields:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/disk/by-id/raid-lsi_chedfhiceaa-part2 swap 
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/disk/by-id/raid-lsi_chedfhiceaa-part3 / 
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/disk/by-id/raid-lsi_chedfhiceaa-part1 /boot
</I>
Well if I go with the by-id device names I would say there is a
hardware raid controller in your machine and it was detected by the
linux kernel as well as there are storage device populated by the
raid controller setup. So I would say everything is fine here ? :)

&gt;<i> My KIWI configuration (which I've put at the end of the email) so far
</I>&gt;<i> is a fairly basic configuration that is meant to provide two different
</I>&gt;<i> builds - a VMX build (which works perfectly) and an OEM one. As I
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned, the machines that the RAID configuration is being built
</I>&gt;<i> on are pretty old, so the only way to install this image on the servers
</I>&gt;<i> is to take the image and separate out the necessary parts to do a PXE
</I>&gt;<i> installation as per <A HREF="http://isny.homelinux.com/data/kiwi.html#sec.oem.pxe-based-installation">http://isny.homelinux.com/data/kiwi.html#sec.oem.pxe-based-installation</A> and, although it boots fine and the configuration is
</I>&gt;<i> installed, the installation only sees two hard drives 
</I>&gt;<i> - /dev/sda and /dev/sdb. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I tried putting the following 'config.00:11:25:29:8D:20' file in the directory SERV/tftpboot/KIWI/
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> DISK=/dev/sda
</I>&gt;<i> IMAGE=/dev/md1;App-Server-11.4.i686;1.0.0;192.168.169.248;8192
</I>&gt;<i> PART=5;S;x,2000;83;/
</I>&gt;<i> RAID=1;/dev/sda;/dev/sdb
</I>
That's the part where things are mixed up. If you have built an oem 
install image and you deploy over the network there is no client
(config.&lt;MAC&gt;) setup required because the oem image is a disk
image and includes everything in one place. That means the oem
image already has the bootloader, partition, filesystems, data on board.
The only major difference in that case is the deployment method.
If you boot the oem install image as an iso it will dump the image
from the CD onto the target. If you boot over pxe it will dump
the image over the network onto the target.

So you are right the config.&lt;MAC&gt; is not used at all in that case

What's really problematic is that in that mode we don't support
raid as I mentioned at the beginning of my mail. The problem is that
an oem image is an all-in-one bundle and so far we don't support
to have software raid as part of this setup. If you want to make
use of the RAID feature you need to create a &quot;real&quot; pxe image

&gt;<i> I hope that's enough information in describing the problem I'm having.
</I>&gt;<i> I've spent a good week trying to figure this portion out so far and haven't
</I>&gt;<i> progressed on it at all, although I'm getting most of the rest of Kiwi.
</I>&gt;<i> If there's anyone that can provide pointers for what I would need to do, 
</I>&gt;<i> that would be great.
</I>
I'm sorry that you had a hard time with kiwi. Unfortunately
along with the trouble I still have some questions ;)

1) which kiwi version do you use

2) Do you want to use hardware or software raid ?
   I mean from what I read it looks like the target machine has
   a linux supported lsi raid controller and there is the disk
   device:

   /dev/disk/by-id/raid-lsi_chedfhiceaa

   if this is the only disk device on that machine the oem install
   procedure should have installed the image there and everything
   is done. If there are multiple disks available you should have
   gotten a selection box to choose the target

3) If you want to use software RAID you have to add the pxe type
   in your image config.xml

   &lt;type image=&quot;pxe&quot; filesystem=&quot;ext3&quot; boot=&quot;netboot/suse-11.4&quot;/&gt;

   Build the pxe image 'kiwi --create ... --type pxe'
   After that take a look into:

   <A HREF="http://isny.homelinux.com/data/kiwi.html#chap.pxe">http://isny.homelinux.com/data/kiwi.html#chap.pxe</A>
   <A HREF="http://isny.homelinux.com/data/kiwi.html#sec.pxe.client-config-file">http://isny.homelinux.com/data/kiwi.html#sec.pxe.client-config-file</A>

   Again only raid1 is supported here at the moment


Hope that helps

Regards,
Marcus
