<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; /dev/disk/by-id/raid-lsi_chedfhiceaa-part2 swap 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; /dev/disk/by-id/raid-lsi_chedfhiceaa-part3 / 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; /dev/disk/by-id/raid-lsi_chedfhiceaa-part1 /boot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well if I go with the by-id device names I would say there is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hardware raid controller in your machine and it was detected by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; linux kernel as well as there are storage device populated by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; raid controller setup. So I would say everything is fine here ? :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but again, this was from a standard 11.4 dist installation.
</I>
ok, that at least means 11.4 has everything to make the device work

&gt;<i> It is a hardware raid controller, but if we have to do this with
</I>&gt;<i> software raid, I don't have a problem with that either. Note that even
</I>&gt;<i> though /dev/sda is used in the OEM boot that I've created,
</I>&gt;<i> 'dmraid -s' tells me that the raid controller is there.
</I>
That means all basic drivers are part of the initrd created by kiwi

&gt;<i> However, it's not in use as I'm able to mount /dev/sdb and nothing is
</I>&gt;<i> on that drive. When I attempt to mount /dev/sdb under a standard 11.4
</I>&gt;<i> install, it tells me that the device is busy and can't be mounted
</I>&gt;<i> (which is the expected behaviour).
</I>
That's the part which confuses me. So normally you setup the raid in
the management software which comes with the controller. The OS later on
just see the devices but the OS does not control or initialize the raid
behavior. In your case I would expect two devices /dev/sda and /dev/sdb
and you can choose one of them to install the system on, the other device
is automatically a mirror of the origin controlled by the hardware
raid controller. Is that correct so far ?

What confuses me is that you have the devices which means the raid
controller driver must be active and working but they don't behave
as a raid1 setup. I'm not familiar with that type of controller but
could it be that:

a) you need additional firmware inside the initrd. You can check
   from your standard installation if there are hardware dependant
   packages installed:

   rpm -qa --qf '\n&lt;%{name}&gt;\n' --supplements | grep -B1 ^modalias | grep '^&lt;'

b) the raid1 setup is not as you expected it

   you can check this in the raid controller management console on boot
   of the target device

c) are the devices controlled by multipath ?
  
   if 'multipath -l' on your standard installation shows something
   this might be the missing part in kiwi, but it would be an odd
   setup.

Other than that you can repeat the oem installation process with
the boot parameter:

   kiwidebug=1

If it comes to the point where you have to select &quot;yes&quot; to install
the image on the target, you can switch to the debugging console Alt-F2
and check the status of the devices while still inside the initrd.
There is only a limited set of commands though. I'm mostly interested
if there are the udev device names /dev/disk/by-id/raid-lsi_....

I think if there is a hardware raid controller in the system it would
be best to use it instead of software raid.

Regards,
Marcus
