<PRE>Hi Guys,

I am running into two distinct problems with kiwi-4.41-124.1.i586 under
OpenSUSE 11.2. The config.xml file I am using at this time is based
right off of:

<A HREF="http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/KIWI/Cookbook_Recipe07">http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/KIWI/Cookbook_Recipe07</A>

And in fact, the only changes I have made are to the elements of the
description block. The image itself builds with out issue, and
regardless of if I boot from a USB stick via the .raw.install.raw file,
or qemu via the .raw file I get the same errors. I suspect I've missed
something, but here's what I am seeing:

The first problem kicks out an error about the
/mnt/var/adm/fillup-templates/sysconfig.kernel file and that it can't be
found. This prevents the system from completing the installation process
and researching as found that in &quot;suseStripInitrd&quot; of the KIWIConfig.sh
script, the /var/adm path is being removed as part of the build process.
I suspect this is done to save space and reduce the size of the image.
As it is also removing the fillup-templates path, it kills the ability
of the system to finish installing things. Removing &quot;/var/adm&quot; from the
list, and adding &quot;/var/adm/update-scripts /var/adm/update-messages
/var/adm/autoinstall /var/adm/backup /var/adm/SuSEconfig
/var/adm/perl-modules&quot; to the files listing in that function resolves
the issue.

The next problem that cropped up after I made that fix is as follows:

After the image switches into a &quot;Preparing preinit phase...&quot; I get the
following error:

-----------------------
===&gt; Calling pre-init stage in system image

===&gt; Creating framebuffer devices
===&gt; Can't create initrd

INIT: version 2.86 booting
INIT: No inittab file found

Enter runlevel:
-----------------------

The &quot;Can't create initrd&quot; failure seems to be the root of the issue, and
googling for any answers returns nothing more the code changes to the
kiwi system. Please let me know what I will need to provide to help
track down what information you need to provide any assistance, in
addition the kiwidebug=1 stage fails to provide a console, as I've
already tried to get a copy of the log file.

Any assistance would be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
