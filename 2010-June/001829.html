<PRE>I am running a very minimal KIWI diskless system. It does not run X. The
only X libraries present are the ones some apps have linked with, even
if they will not use X in this context.

I now want to ssh into my KIWI system and start an X application that
should display where I have ssh'd from.  The problem is that ssh is not
setting up the DISPLAY variable on the KIWI system, and the socket for X
is not started on the system I ssh from. The system I ssh from is
configured properly for this. It works against 'regular' openSUSE
systems. It only fails against the KIWI system. 

The problem is most likely that I am missing some components on the KIWI
system, so the X stuff does not get set up. I have asked on the general
openSUSE list, and all we could agree on was that something is probably
missing. But what?

I know this is perhaps not really a KIWI question, as KIWI is most
likely not doing anything other than I have told it to do. But I ask
here because other KIWI users may have experienced similar problems and
know of a solution. At least I hope so!
