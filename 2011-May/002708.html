<PRE>Hi All,

Today there was a meeting with the new leadership team for the
newly established SuSE business unit. As it was said that it's
important to communicate the information I would like to take
the oppurtunity to share the most important details concerning
the appliance program and kiwi with you.

* Community work is key to success. This means kiwi will stay
  an opensource project. Important for me personally; It also
  will stay open for other Linux based operating systems.

* The appliance program which includes the base technologies as
  well as products like 'SuSE Studio' and 'SuSE Onsite' are treated
  as important. At the moment and to my knowledge this means we
  will stay with our development team now funded by the SuSE BU.
  I will continue to lead and drive forward the project according
  to the needs of the community and our customers

* They strongly stated that innovation happens, but the focus
  is concentrated to how much it matters to customers who are
  also willing to pay for it.

* In the long run it was said that it is important to become
  profitable with each of the SuSE products. I interpret this in
  a way that, if we make money with appliances, virtualization
  and cloud computing this project has a bright future ;)

If you have questions, please do not hesitate to write them
here on the list or directly to me.

Thanks

Kind regards,
Marcus
