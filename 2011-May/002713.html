<PRE>We are running kiwi v4.86.  We are building an oem iso/stick installer using the oemboot/suse-SLES11 boot config.  It doesn't look like the firmware files from kernel-default-base are being included in the initrd that is created.  When we boot we are getting error messages from the kernel as follows:
bnx2: Can't load firmware file &quot;bnx2/bnx2-mips-09-5.0.0.j9.fw&quot;

As far as I can tell our config.xml is including the kernel-default-base package, as is the oemboot/suse-SLES11 config.xml.nn

I do most of my testing on Virtual Machines, so have not seen this problem until recently when I tried to move back to testing on our hardware platform.
We need the bnx2 firmware that is in the kernel-default-base package.  I'm pretty sure that it was being included previously, as prior moving to kiwi v4.71 we had been testing on the hardware.

I tried building the suse-SLE11-JeOS oem install iso to see if the firmware would be included in the initrd, but they are not.

Can anyone help me with how to troubleshoot/fix this issue?

Thank you,
