<PRE>Hi David,

thanks for testing the patch

&gt;<i> And it looks like the patch works!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I really appreciate the effort to come up with something that will
</I>&gt;<i> workfor my needs, but I'm really starting to doubt the split-image approach
</I>&gt;<i> will work for me.
</I>
Well even if you have realized that split maybe not working for you
it has at least brought in a good enhancement in describing the read-write
read-only sections. So it definitely was worth the effort

&gt;<i> Another problem is the initrd.  I want my devices to boot from the drive (CF card in my case) without PXE, so I use the KIWI_INITRD parameter in the config.MAC file.  This downloads a workable initrd into the image when the device is imaged.  However, it would be extremely convoluted to get the initrd into the read-only image part.  So now I have to have /boot exist in the read-write partition.  The same headaches apply for grub configuration files, and in general to making any persistent changes to the read-only partition without re-imaging the device or going through contortions to make the read-only tree consistent across reboots.
</I>
right. I'm sorry but the kiwi initrd is the only one which works with
the split type. That's because it's something only kiwi provides and
therefore we can't replace/recreate the initrd by a simple mkinitrd call.
At any time when the kernel changes one needs to re-create the kiwi initrd
with kiwi and also needs to take care how to activate the new initrd.
I saw people who provided kiwi and the boot image description (initrd)
as part of the image and use it for re-creating the initrd. I guess this
is also not an option for you

&gt;<i> I don't even really need a read-write partition - maybe it was a mistake to make you think I did.  I think it is useful for me, but not at all necessary - I was planning on keeping /var/log/ in the persistent partition and that's it - since I can remote syslog.
</I>
ok :-)

&gt;<i> Do you have a kiwi image recommendation for an autonomous (no PXE-boot) diskful read-only image that can be mounted read-write when desired to make persistent OS updates without having to re-image the device?  I do really like the PXE-boot approach to loading the image onto the device, but the PXE-boot is just for initial device provisioning/configuration.
</I>
I think if you build a simple image based on a standard fileystem for example
ext3 you will get an image which is read-write at any time. To make it read-only
while the image is active you need to provide the /etc/fstab with the &quot;ro&quot; 
mount option in it. The kiwi initrd creates that file but not with this option.
So you can create a clone from the appropriate boot image description and
change that accordingly.

I would suggest to use the oemboot image type for that:

	&lt;type filesystem=&quot;ext3&quot; boot=&quot;oemboot/suse-davids-clone&quot;&gt;oem&lt;/type&gt;

The result is a virtual disk image which you can dd onto your device. You
also can create an installable image from that image which allows you to
&quot;install&quot; (deploy) it from for example a CD or DVD

How does an update work. The virtual disk partitions can be accessed the
following way:

    losetup /dev/loop0 &lt;the-image-file&gt; 
    kpartx -a /dev/loop0

==&gt; now you can see the partitions as /dev/mapper/loop0p1 and you can
    mount them read write:

    mount /dev/mapper/loop0p1 /mnt

==&gt; After the changes you need to redeploy. I'm not sure if this is acceptable
    for you. As you have said the system is read-only there is no data which
    could get lost during runtime (except RAM data) so I assume this would
    work for you. Not sure about it 

Just my thinkings

Regards,
Marcus
