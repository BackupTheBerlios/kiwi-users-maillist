Marcus,

I've repeated the tests with kiwi 2.37 with the same results
as in 2.36.

Yes, the rootfs.tar file is uncompressed inside the squashfs now,
but no improvement with the RAM memory problem. The created
LiveCD still needs 688MB of RAM to start.

Any idea on where can I search for savings in RAM ?

thanks a lot,

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ok, updated to 2.36 and done all tests.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Right, the file rootfs.tar.gz contains complete /var /etc and /home
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ( with files and directories ), the rest ( /lib /usr ... ) are real
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dirs with simlinks to files to the read-only part. This is OK as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you've stated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ok
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * The log you sent shows:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   252MB left in tmpfs and 143MB required for the uncompressed archive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   With the latest kiwi version we allow up to 512MB for a tmpfs but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   that's not a problem for you. My problem is that I think my RAM space
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   calculation could be wrong because if we extract the tarball into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   a tmpfs the tar and gzip programs also requires RAM space to operate.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   Maybe there are RAM caches when extracting which gets freed afterwards
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   but during the process we may need more RAM space. It would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   interesting if you can try to run that image within qemu and call
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   it like the following:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     qemu -cdrom &lt;the-iso&gt; -m 512
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   does that work ? if not it should work with -m 1024 as you already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   have tested. I would like to know in case of a successful boot how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   much RAM is still available (cat /proc/meminfo).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm using VMWare Workstation 6, hope this is not an inconvenience.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you think it is, I'll switch to qemu.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't matter which virtualisation platform you use. I use
</I>&gt;<i> qemu just because it's easier to become installed :) 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No, it still doesn't boot with 512 MB of RAM. Now I need 688 MB, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is far less than 800 MB of my last try, un still far from the desired
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 512 MBminimum.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The tests where run at intervals of 4 MB of RAM and 688 resulted the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first RAM value which booted OK, the memory data you asked for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a successful boot is shown above in the email.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for all your tests I really appreciate it. I have done some
</I>&gt;<i> tests myself too and I think I could imagine what the problem is.
</I>&gt;<i> the rootfs tarball exists as a compressed tarball on a compressed
</I>&gt;<i> filesystem. When kiwi uncompresses this tarball into RAM space
</I>&gt;<i> the system also needs RAM space for the decompression of this file
</I>&gt;<i> from the filesystem and it needs RAM for the tar program in order
</I>&gt;<i> to be able to uncompress the compressed tarball. According to this
</I>&gt;<i> it's about 3 times more RAM compared to the size of the tar file
</I>&gt;<i> assuming a compression rate of 50%
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it is not a good idea to have the tarball as compressed
</I>&gt;<i> file because it gets compressed by the compressed squashfs
</I>&gt;<i> filesystem anywayJ. Therefore I changed the archive creation
</I>&gt;<i> and don't create a compressed tarball.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But when the system untar's the archive into RAM it still needs
</I>&gt;<i> more RAM than the archive itself because the file is read as
</I>&gt;<i> an entity from the compressed filesystem. Therefore I estimated
</I>&gt;<i> that the system needs twice the size of the archive to be able
</I>&gt;<i> to uncompress the archive into RAM. I don't know if this would
</I>&gt;<i> work reliable but in my tests it was at least better than
</I>&gt;<i> before :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will checkin the change into version 2.37 maybe you can give
</I>&gt;<i> it a try again. Your tar file was compressed about 150MB so I guess
</I>&gt;<i> it will be about 300MB uncompressed. The squashfs filesystem will
</I>&gt;<i> compress that again and your image will not change its size. When
</I>&gt;<i> this 300MB tarball needs to be untared into RAM you need temporary
</I>&gt;<i> about 600MB of RAM space. That's more than your 512MB limit. At
</I>&gt;<i> the moment I don't know how we could prevent that. I'm sorry
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Marcus
