<PRE>Hello Community

I am happy to announce yet another milestone of KIWI-LTSP development.
KIWI-LTSP is LTSP5 implementation in openSUSE using KIWI imaging
technology.

Instructions to get you started are here: <A HREF="http://en.opensuse.org/LTSP">http://en.opensuse.org/LTSP</A>

Installation is still as simple as 1-click to install all the required
packages, one configuration file and one command kiwi-ltsp-setup -s.

Developer's page, bug tracker, mailing lists:
<A HREF="http://developer.novell.com/wiki/index.php/KIWI-LTSP">http://developer.novell.com/wiki/index.php/KIWI-LTSP</A>

We won an award in the process of working on this project :)
<A HREF="http://www.efytimes.com/efytimes/24867/news.htm">http://www.efytimes.com/efytimes/24867/news.htm</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.openitis.com/openitis/project_view.php?id=130,">http://www.openitis.com/openitis/project_view.php?id=130,</A> this
motivated me to fill up gsoc organization application..

There are tons of improvements all around. Some of the enhancements are :

* Improved performance, now clients with as little as 128M ram would
be able to work.
* Image sizes are greatly reduced, resulting in less build time and
low resource requirement on the client.
* New LDM theme and shiny new logo thanks to BiswajyotiM.
* New package ltsp-server that installs all the configuration files
and scripts required to run on the server.
* It is now possible to select language and session from LDM (earlier
ldm used nc command in stead of netcat)
* lts.conf moved out of chroot image, this will allow you to change
anything that that config without having to re-create squashfs image.
* If you want any other configuration files to be served they can be
put in /srv/tftpboot/KIWI and enter it in /srv/tftpboot/config.MAC(or
config.default), see /usr/share/doc/packages/kiwi/kiwi.pdf for more
information.
* This is the first release that has packages built for openSUSE
Factory, openSUSE 10.3 and Fedora 8. On Fedora of course you need to
use your local image building tools that Warren has been working on.
* Couple of switches are added to kiwi-ltsp-setup commandline tool to
facilitate power users to build/configure selected component.
* Local media such as USB disks and CD/DVD now automatically mount,
they show up in /tmp/.$USER-ltspfs. If you want them to show up on
your desktop instead, SUID /usr/bin/lbmount.
* We now use PulseAudio for sound, everything should work out of box
without any configuration, however flash or any videos will suck bad.

Known Issue:

* Local hard disk does not mount for some reason
* Does not boot clients with less than 128M ram

Thank you shaefi - KIWI developer, ogra, vagrantc, gadi, warren and
all the LTPS developers and captain_magnus - KIWI-LTSP co-developer.

Have fun with it, and do share your wishes and report bugs of which I
am sure will be plenty.

Apologies for posting on so many groups and if you get this more than one.

-J
