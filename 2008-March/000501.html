<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; no the contents of your own _system_ image description stays untouched.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the kiwi-desc-* packages provides the boot image descriptions for creating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the initrd which you shouldn't have touched at all. If you had for some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reasons the need for your own boot image description you should have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; created a copy of the description directory of your choice and rename it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In that case an update of the boot image descriptions will not touch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your own stuff
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ok,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> but what will happen when the config.xml is redesigned by the developer.
</I>
sorry you are the developer/designer of your own image
description, arent't you ?

&gt;<i> In this case I ve to check both files for changes and pittfalls.
</I>
The question is why do you need changes in a _boot_ image description
I have asked you that several times but you didn't answer this question.
I also told you if your change is generic enough I would love to integrate
it into the common boot descriptions. And if your change is somewhat
special then you are right and you need to maintain two image descriptions
because nobody else than you can better maintain the special changes
you require. But again I still don't have any clue why you require
a change in the boot image ?

&gt;<i> I think an include-option to import own config-informations would be a
</I>&gt;<i> usefull feature.
</I>
It would end in a mess. I'm sorry to say it like that but it's true :)
the image description builds an entity which should have been tested
by the designer of the description. If someone else uses that description
he or she can easily add/delete/rename stuff but if that changes the
original intention of the image it should be done by first creating a
copy of the description. If the change is more like a fix it is no
problem to store it.

If you need to add software as a temporary extension to an image
description you already have the possibility to use

	--ignore-repos --set-repo/--set-repotype --add-repo
	--add-package

But I think it would help a lot if you could explain exactly
where you see the problem

Thanks 

Regards,
Marcus
