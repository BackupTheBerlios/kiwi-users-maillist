With ltsp-4 such applications could be run locally on the thin client.
However, this was not easy to do as a big part of the used distribution
had to be compiled and made available for the thin client.
This should be solved with the introduction of ltps-5..., now that ltsp-5
is available it would great if applications can indeed be installed
locally on the thin client.  If that would be the case than I think,
that the user will launch the application (e.g. firefox or GE) from
the server at the thin client.  It will also need to tell the application
to display it on the thin client....  This setup requires that a part
of distribution that is needed to run FF or GE is installed on the
thin client...

What I understood from you sofar, this is not possilbe (maybe yet)
Will it possible in the future??
