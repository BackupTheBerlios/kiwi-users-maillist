<PRE>Hello Marcus,
&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I know the syslinux maintainer and I'm pretty sure we can include
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that in the upcoming version. Will talk to him
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That would be just great ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> just talked to him. We are aware of the gfxboot patches and our
</I>&gt;<i> syslinux maintainer will include them. At the moment we are waiting
</I>&gt;<i> because syslinux provides a new version every day at the moment :-)
</I>&gt;<i> So be sure you can rely on the new syslinux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>well, we are using 3.51 or 3.53 which has been in the market for some 
time and seems to be very stable (to me).
It has some essential options like -d that are missing from the version 
coming with opensuse right now.
&gt;&gt;<i> Another question has occured to me today when dealing with the kiwi sticks 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on different machines.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sax autoconfiguration is taking place on initial startup of a kiwi USB 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stick, and xorg.conf is written to the persistent partition.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the same stick is booted next time on another PC (which is quite it's 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> purpose), xorg usually fails because the old xorg.conf with the prior 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configuration of graphics card, mouse and monitor is used.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Shouldn't there be some instance in opensuse that autodetects the hardware 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configuration and - in case there are some differences - reconfigures the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system or X11?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you are definitely right here and yast provides a basic system to
</I>&gt;<i> handle that but we have a hard time integrating it and I would prefer
</I>&gt;<i> a solution which works without yast. I think it would be a nice task
</I>&gt;<i> for someone who is interested to implement such a mechanism which checks
</I>&gt;<i> at boot time if the hwinfo provided hardware ID's has changed. This is
</I>&gt;<i> also an area where I didn't found time to work on yet
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I was not sure how yast is working internally.
I thought that yast was just a framework with components like sax2 inside.
So I would have split out the component responsible for hw-detection and 
added it to kiwi.
But probably it's not as easy as that ;-)
I could add sax2 -a into the initscripts, maybe that will fix the 
problem for now.
&gt;<i>   
</I>Thanks!
Bernd
