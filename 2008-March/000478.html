<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I guess it is just semantics, but in my mind, I am the one who wants a true read-only filesystem - a filesystem that DOES NOT allow any writes during filesystem operation.  I would describe your squashfs-based read-only fs as a filesystem that persists across system boots.  But during system operation, your &quot;read-only&quot; filesystem is very much write-able.  My point is: when you unpack a rootfs tarball into tmpfs, that is not a read-only filesystem.  The usefulness of either of these approaches just depends on the use case, but it's difficult here using the same words to describe different operating modes and requirements.
</I>
well readonly filesystem is in my eyes a filesystem which you can't write
on no matter what you do or how you mount it. squashfs is such a fs like
cramfs or some others which even doesn't implement the write hook. If you
don't specify any split information the rootfs tarball contains only links
which points to the read-only filesystem and therefore no operation can
write anything. This also includes logging functions and due to the fact
that suse uses PAM authentification PAM also can't log a login attempt
which is fatal for PAM which means you can't login to the system but
it's surely read only as you want it to be.

So it's not the type specification which creates the operational mode
but the description of what you want to have read-only and what should
be read-write which is all about the split section. The type itself
defines only the filesystem which should be used for the read-only
and the read-write portion. 

As we mount the read-only filesystem with the -o ro option  
I don't have any objections to allow other filesystems in fsreadonly
if it is what you require ?

Regards,
Marcus
