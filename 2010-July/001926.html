<PRE>Hi all,

I'm trying to create a LiveCD based off of SLES 11 SP1 JeOS, but I
only want the CD to serve as an installation medium -- not as a trial
version of the OS. As I'm required to have this CD work with arbitrary
hardware as well as be the source for a VM installation, the VM
installer and OEM image installer won't work -- it's LiveCD or nothing
as far as I understand the Kiwi documentation.

Basically, what I want is something that works like a run-of-the-mill
SuSE installation CD without the option to run a live desktop. Here's
what I imagine the process should look like once the user inserts the
CD and boots off of it:

1) A graphical menu appears at or just after initial boot time with
&quot;graphical install&quot; and &quot;text install&quot; options on it, but no option to
actually start the desktop environment/etc. off the CD. It's okay for
the CD to display a text-only menu and only have the &quot;text install&quot;
option if it is running on hardware that is not graphics-capable.

2) As soon as the user selects one of the install options, it will
then finish booting the OS (if necessary) and run through the
installation procedure, which will have some custom AutoYaST
configurations and .yac modules, as necessary, to automate parts of
the installation the user is not to change while still asking the user
for things such as network configuration.

3) The final installation on the device's hard drive will only contain
what's necessary to run a text-mode only appliance. Even if X11 was on
the CD to facilitate a graphical installation, it will not be
installed on the destination appliance.

In my blind stumbling, I've managed to tweak things to sort of run the
installer after booting, but I have various issues -- grub errors,
YaST complaining it can't find a license file, etc. It also looks
pretty ugly as I got the graphical installer running without a window
manager.

Can anyone provide me with any tips or even HOWTOs/websites on how to
accomplish my task? Thanks!
