I moved from Thinstation to KIWI a while back. I also have need to
classing equipment into various groups. I have found that I can use the
domain-name variable. I have attached my dhcpd.conf file. I made each
class of hardware into a group. Then I just add system to the group I
want them to be in. The dhcpd.conf file is the only place I need to
specify anything about any system.

In KIWI, I start the various services via a single rc script. It sees
the domain-name as DNSDOMAIN. This is part of my rc script:

      case &quot;${DNSDOMAIN}&quot; in

              mca)    echo -n &quot;for MCA &quot;
                      start_mca
                      ;;
              jboc)   echo -n &quot;for just a bunch of computers &quot;
                      start_jboc
                      ;;
              dpavue) echo -n &quot;for digital PAVUE &quot;    
                      start_dpavue
                      ;;
              rangere55) echo -n &quot;for SICK Ranger E55 &quot;  
                         start_rangere55
                        ;;
              test)   echo -n &quot;for testing &quot;  
                      start_test
                      ;;
              *)      echo -n &quot;however, ${DNSDOMAIN} is not recognized &quot;
                      ;;
      esac
