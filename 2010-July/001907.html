<PRE>Hi Marcus,

Thanks for the response. Unfortunately the terminals are not grouped by
IP, but by function. In addition the MAC addresses are not group-able
via the standard PXE abilities due to a mix of hardware vendors being used.

What would the feasibility of incorporating a means of being able to
create a groups file that would act as a third layer on top of the PXE
structure?

We are attempting to transition off of Thinstation as that project has
had little to no activity over the last few years, and we really need to
be able to update/upgrade images as new applications come online. One of
the most useful facilities we use extensively that Thinstation provides
is the groups capabilities and environment variable loading facilities
to &quot;tweak&quot; each station group.
