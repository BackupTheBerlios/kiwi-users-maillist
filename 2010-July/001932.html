<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; The image type you need here is an oem plus install media like this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;type image=&quot;oem&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; &#160; &#160;filesystem=&quot;ext3&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; &#160; &#160;boot=&quot;oemboot/suse-SLES11&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; &#160; &#160;installiso=&quot;true&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; /&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The image and the install iso works on arbitrary as well as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; installation media for VM systems
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks. But does this install iso allow us to do any of the following
</I>&gt;<i> before booting off the installation target:
</I>&gt;<i> * Hardware detection with the ability to add/remove packages from the
</I>&gt;<i> installation target?
</I>
that should be done by an autoyast script during boot of the system
kiwi detects the hardware required for running the system which means
the disk, possibly network, etc... but it will never setup your
sound card or something. All this must be done when the system runs.
You have several options here. As Jordi already said you can setup
a web page, you can also use an autoyast script, or you can write
your own workflow

&gt;<i>  * Or can we add additional packages to oemboot/suse-SLES11 to modify
</I>&gt;<i> the installation CD itself so that it does hardware detection and
</I>&gt;<i> add/remove packages?
</I>
you can do that but you shouldn't because oemboot/suse-SLES11 is
the initrd and not the system. You have only a very minimalistic system
here and the risk of failure is high. Additionally oemboot is delivered
as part of the kiwi package set and we maintain the provided functionality
If you change it to your needs you are alone with errors :-)
It would be much easier and better to put packages into the system
image as overlay files and handle them while the system boots up in
a runlevel script or on your desktop with a desktop startup script

&gt;<i> * Can we modify partitioning for an OEM install during installation?
</I>
to some degree:

- you can specify swap and swapsize
- you can specify home

if you use LVM which is the preferred method when using kiwi images
you are free to create as much volumes (partitions) as you like

&gt;<i> * Is Yast/Autoyast available before booting off the installation target?
</I>
no, yast is available in your system image not in the initrd.
So you can run it after the init process is called to boot up the
system. But you don't have to take care for the call yourself. if
there is a autoyast script part of the image description kiwi sets up
the environment so that it is called on first boot automatically.
You only have to make sure there is a working X configuration so that
it can start in graphics mode... or you'd be fine using the textmode
interface

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 3) The final installation on the device's hard drive will only contain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; what's necessary to run a text-mode only appliance. Even if X11 was on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the CD to facilitate a graphical installation, it will not be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; installed on the destination appliance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you can influence all that yourself by defining what pattern
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and packages should make up the oem system image
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does this mean that we can add packages to the ISO boot image
</I>&gt;<i> independently of the system image that we install?
</I>
no that means you specify the contents of the system image.
You can put whatever you like there

Regards,
Marcus
