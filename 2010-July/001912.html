<PRE>Hi Marcus,

We've made it past the initial issue with the repartitioning of the CF
cards we are using, but we are now running into another issue that has
me confused. I've been forced to increment the major version number,
even after leaving the config.xml and size of the image alone, and it's
completely hit or miss as to whether it will work.

This could simply be me miss-reading things again, but here's what we
are doing:

I've solidified the package information and am simply making adjustments
in the config.sh and images.sh files. The changes to the config.sh file
are simply adjusting the default window manager, autologin aspects, and
disabling some services we don't need. The changes in the images.sh have
been to retain some x-windows drivers that we use, but were being removed.

Each time I've incremented the release value, and left the Major and
minor numbers alone (as per your own defined rules for it).

When I rebuild the image, deploy and attempt to reboot the terminal, we
get the following set of errors:


Failed to mount ext3 clic container
Failed to mount root filesystem
attempt to access beyond end of device
loop0: rw=0, wamt=4319144069, limit=6595072
JBD: Failed to read block at offset 15
JBD: recovery failed
EXT3-fs: error loading journal

Also, where can I enable the kiwidebug=1 variable so that we can gain
shell access, things are occurring too quickly after the PXE image
booting phase to be able to catch a spot to enter it? I suspect it would
be in the pxelinux.cfg/default file, but just want to confirm first.
