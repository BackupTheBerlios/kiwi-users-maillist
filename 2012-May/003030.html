Hi Marcus, 

Thanks for your response. I have already tried the following value 

my $minMB  = 60. 

In addition, I have also tried the following values (both in KIWIImage.pm and KIWIBoot.pm) : 

my $fsoverhead   = 1.2 
my $spare        = 10 * 1024 * 1024 


Although it has helped to some extent, I still see some 100MBs getting added to the size of the .raw.file. The current partitions are 

read-only : 306 MB 
read-write : 48 MB 
/boot : 60 MB 

This totals to 414 MB. But the .raw image size is 514 MB. So I am trying to figure out where the 100 MB is getting added. Perhaps there lies my solution. 

Any ideas where this 100 MB could be getting added. 

Regards, 
Rahul

</I>Hi,

&gt;<i>    I am building an OEM Split image based on SLED 11 SP2. The image needs
</I>&gt;<i>    to fit into a 512MB Flash Disk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Although the size of my read-only part is 308 MB and the read-write
</I>&gt;<i>    part is 48 MB, the size of the .raw file is reaching 516 MB. I also see
</I>&gt;<i>    that a separate /boot partition is getting created and that the min
</I>&gt;<i>    size of /boot partition was set to 150MB. I managed to reduce the
</I>&gt;<i>    partition size to 70MB, but I actually want to eliminate the separate
</I>&gt;<i>    boot partition.
</I>
One of the changes in newer kiwi versions was to have a seperate boot
partition for split systems. That's because you can configure the
filesystem of the readonly and the readwrite partition and in order
to make sure the bootloader works with all of them we also have a
seperate /boot space which is ext3 by default. So I'm afraid I can't
offer you to eliminate the separate boot partition completely.

&gt;<i>    The earlier version of kiwi did not create a separate /boot partition
</I>&gt;<i>    by default.
</I>
This is correct we setup the boot data into the read-write space
but this has turned out to lead to other problems if the read-write
fs is not supported by e.g grub

&gt;<i>    * How to reduce the size of the .raw file ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    My target size for the .raw file is 488 MB which is the available
</I>&gt;<i>    usable space in the Flash Disk on the Thin Client. I have a much
</I>&gt;<i>    smaller image (based on SLED 11) already running on this Thin Client,
</I>&gt;<i>    but it was created using a much older version of Kiwi.
</I>
If ok with you I'd like to suggest the following test.

  vi /usr/share/kiwi/modules/KIWIBoot.pm

  sub __getBootSize {
     ...
  }

  change the line

  my $minMB  = 150;

  into something of your choice and rebuild the image.
  If you get it down to the value you require I will add the minimum
  boot space an option in the XML description.

  Reason for the 150MB boot space is to handle kernel updates
  But for thin systems this might be too much and also not
  required

If you cannot solve the problem with this change it is in any case
hard to get SUSE down to 512MB these days. If you cannot leave out
or uninstall (forced) packages you can only remove data on a file
by file basis. Whenever I'm in that trouble I start removing
stuff like:

   /usr/share/doc
   /usr/share/icons
   /usr/share/gnome/help-...
  
but this is no fun and should be avoided whenever possible

Regards,
Marcus
