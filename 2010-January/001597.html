<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> The files I am generating in my most recent builds are bigger than they
</I>&gt;<i> were in the past. I know that is the way of these things. But I wonder
</I>&gt;<i> if the size increases below are as one would expect:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> File           10.3     11.2
</I>&gt;<i> ---------- -------- --------
</I>&gt;<i> kernel      1593816  3672800  +57%
</I>&gt;<i> initrd     18425407 28988294  +36%     
</I>&gt;<i> root       28856320 34496681  +12%
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The kernel and initrd are pretty much under the control of kiwi, as I am
</I>&gt;<i> using the default definitions. The root partition is controlled by my
</I>&gt;<i> scripts. Right?
</I>
This is correct yes.

Talking about the size increase:

1) yes the kernel is much much bigger in 11.2 compared to 10.3 because
   Greg put many things into the kernel which are available as modules
   before. The kiwi initrd code can control the amount of modules but it
   can't control the size of the kernel image

2) the initrd rise is mostly caused by the need of modules libs for
   the internationalization. I have to leave stuff like locales, texts
   encodings and fonts in the initrd to support for example the display
   of chinese characters. the locale setup of your system image controls
   how many locales will be part of the initrd but the basic components
   especially fonts are choosen from a fixed unicode font which is big
   other reasons for the rise are additional tools and many many
   new features and bug reports for the initrd between 10.3 and 11.2
   (Example LVM support)

&gt;<i> Do these sizes look reasonable for the smallest one can get with basic
</I>&gt;<i> networking, and no X or X apps?
</I>
I wouldn't touch the initrd but the root filesystem can surely be
tweaked to a smaller size depending on your requirements. But it will
take you some time (maybe too much time) to find the various small
pieces you don't need. I'm sure there is no big chunk left you can
safely remove

suse is not really small and has many library dependencies there
are other distros which are easier to keep small. The LTSP people
did a great job to make it small and still usable so I think they
can also provide good input what can be done to make it smaller

Regards,
Marcus
