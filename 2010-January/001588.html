<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> This setup is pretty simple: an installation into a directory is exported 
</I>&gt;<i> ro (e.g. the result of kiwi --prepare), adjusted to diskless needs (a few 
</I>&gt;<i> network/ldap settings, don't stop eth0 on shutdown, a simple automatic X 
</I>&gt;<i> setup with sax). All nodes boot from the same kernel/initrd, which 
</I>&gt;<i> overlays a node specific rw nfs path (with aufs). 
</I>
One thing you should have in mind is that aufs is not supported by
the kernel community there are some design aspects which are not accepted
by the kernel people and therefore aufs is already not part of 11.2
anymore. So a concept based on aufs will unfortunately not survive
very long

I think you are using aufs because you want to separate the write actions
per client into a network location which makes sense to me. kiwi could
arrange your current setup with aufs but I don't recommend to make use
of it. As an alternative you can think of a clicfs based image with
AoE (Ata over Ethernet). It works that way:

- the basic image is a compressed clicfs file which is exported via
  AoE (vbladed). Each client mounts the exported block device as it's root

- the copy-on-write actions go to a cow file or into RAM. The location
  for the cow file can also be an nfs exported rw space. At the moment
  I have implemented writing to RAM, writing into a cow file on NFS is
  still missing but can be done in a day 

&gt;<i> It looks like current technologies in this area are not able to mimic that 
</I>&gt;<i> fully out of the box. Aufs cannot use a nfs mount for its xino file, and I 
</I>&gt;<i> do not want to give up on the two nfs mounts, either. But I might want to 
</I>&gt;<i> add nfs or nbd based swap (now, that's available). Looks like, that I need 
</I>&gt;<i> to use an tmpfs for the xino.
</I>
As I said I wouldn't use aufs at all for a new concept. If the machine
needs to swap you can use swap over NFS. imho that's fast enough and
mainframe architectures like s390 does that too :)

&gt;<i> It would be kind, if you/someone could give me a few hints, what would be 
</I>&gt;<i> the best way to realize this with the help of kiwi. Is there an interest 
</I>&gt;<i> to add this functionality to netboot/suse-11.1, or should I create a new 
</I>&gt;<i> image for that. Any pitfalls, I should be aware of?
</I>
There is always a lot of interest to add something useful for the
people using kiwi :-) I could add the missing functionality into kiwi
if you think clicfs and AoE is something you would like to test
I have that on my plate anyway it's bug: #570960

&gt;<i> 15 seconds wasted for searching some usb devices :-( Whould be cool the get 
</I>&gt;<i> rid of it.
</I>
I'm working on that too it's bug: #570961

Regards,
Marcus
