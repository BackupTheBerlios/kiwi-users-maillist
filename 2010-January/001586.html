<PRE>Dear Marcus and the other kiwis around,

I'm in the need to get a 11.1 diskless setup going quickly, since I failed 
to adapt a current kernel (necessary because of new hardware) to a well 
established, rock solid SuSE 9.3 Prof. based diskless desktop setup for a 
company.. None of the desktops has any kind of persistent storage, btw.

This setup is pretty simple: an installation into a directory is exported 
ro (e.g. the result of kiwi --prepare), adjusted to diskless needs (a few 
network/ldap settings, don't stop eth0 on shutdown, a simple automatic X 
setup with sax). All nodes boot from the same kernel/initrd, which 
overlays a node specific rw nfs path (with aufs). 

The beauty of this setup is, that I'm able to adjust each node to specific 
needs: cdrom, sound, X _once_ (e.g. with YaST). I could even install 
special rpms to selected hosts, if I want, but I'm still enjoying the 
install once, use everywhere property, even if it's five years old now..

It looks like current technologies in this area are not able to mimic that 
fully out of the box. Aufs cannot use a nfs mount for its xino file, and I 
do not want to give up on the two nfs mounts, either. But I might want to 
add nfs or nbd based swap (now, that's available). Looks like, that I need 
to use an tmpfs for the xino.

It would be kind, if you/someone could give me a few hints, what would be 
the best way to realize this with the help of kiwi. Is there an interest 
to add this functionality to netboot/suse-11.1, or should I create a new 
image for that. Any pitfalls, I should be aware of?

At the moment, I'm toying with a config based on suse-pxe-client, but it
behaves a bit strange:

15 seconds wasted for searching some usb devices :-( Whould be cool the get 
rid of it. The userspace squashfs on the server is from the filesystems repo.

If I mount the --prepare path:

[Game over]

Been there, fixed that once.. 

TIA,
