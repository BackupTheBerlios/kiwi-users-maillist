<PRE>Marcus,

Thanks once again.  Your answers and instructions are very clear.  Let me 
answer your questions:

Yes, the simpler my changes can be, the better.  I will attempt to use the 
delivered oemboot package (and its associated config.xml) for my build.
I need some extra 32-bit packages to support our large application which 
is still compiled for 32-bit and requires these 32-bit libraries.

I will load your new v4.65 kiwi version and try again.

Just for reference, could you include the command to patch kiwi with you 
kiwi.dif file should I need to do this in the future?

Regards,

J.

Re: [Kiwi-users] Adding drivers to the system image initrd






Hi,

&gt;<i> I altered my main config.xml to the new schemaversion and added the 
</I>&gt;<i> bootinclude=&quot;true&quot; to the package lines that I need in the initrd.  I 
</I>know 
&gt;<i> complete the &quot;kiwi --prepare&quot; step successfully and the system directory 
</I>
&gt;<i> created has my new kernel and the added drivers in the initrd under the 
</I>&gt;<i> boot/ directory.  Great!
</I>
Sounds good so far :)

&gt;<i> I now fail the &quot;kiwi --create&quot; step...
</I>
Uh, I found several small issue and also a &quot;problem&quot; in kiwi which
causes the error you got: Ok let's start:

1) your log said:

   ---snip---
   Installing: megaraid_sas-v00.00.04.33-2 [error]
   Installation of megaraid_sas-v00.00.04.33-2 failed:
   (with --nodeps --force) Error: Subprocess failed. Error: RPM failed: 
/dev/shm is not a directory
   error: %post(megaraid_sas-v00.00.04.33-2.x86_64) scriptlet failed, exit 
status 1
   ---snap---

   I don't know why the post install of this package accesses /dev/shm
   but it's the reason why it failed to install. dev/shm is not yet
   mounted at that time. I fixed this in kiwi. A patch is attached

2) The changes you made to the oemboot config.xml are not required.
   Basically it's always better to leave the *boot descriptions as
   they are. I suggest to re-install the kiwi-desc-oemboot package
   to be back at a clean state here:

   * &lt;file name=&quot;drivers/scsi/megaraid/*&quot;/&gt;, not required because
     there is already &lt;file name=&quot;drivers/scsi/*&quot;/&gt; added which includes
     &quot;megaraid&quot;

   * &lt;package name=&quot;megaraid_sas-v00.00.04.33&quot;/&gt;, not required
     that's what you achieve with the line:
     &lt;package name=&quot;megaraid_sas-v00.00.04.33&quot; bootinclude=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
     in your image config.xml

   So if you don't mind revert that back by just installing the
   standard kiwi-desc-oemboot package. Thanks

3) Your system image config.xml includes some weird things:

   * botincluded kernel and packages with version strings. It's not
     recommended to do that. You have added a repo /work/kernelnew
     which I think provides the new kernel and also the megaraid
     package. zypper automatically uses the latest version of a package
     which means it will prefer the new kernel and you don't have
     to add those packages with version strings in it. Additionally
     kiwi uses the same repos you have setup in the system image
     config.xml to build the initrd so you only have to bootinclude
     the one missing package &quot;megaraid_sas&quot;

   * why do you add -32bit packages in your config.xml ? 
 
I have attached my version of your config.xml and also transfered it
to the current schema. The file is attached for your reference.
I was able to build the split image with it and the latest kiwi
version v4.65 which I will release today:

  
<A HREF="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Virtualization:/Appliances/openSUSE_11.1/">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Virtualization:/Appliances/openSUSE_11.1/</A>

 
you might consider to update to that kiwi version as it also includes
the fix which seems required in your case. Alternatively you can patch
your local version with the attached dif

Hope that brings you any further

Regards,
Marcus
