<PRE>Just for information - I have solved the problem with partition layout,
I have now bootable usb stick with split filesystem and FAT partition,
which is accesible from Windows machines.

The solution is quite simple, instead of rewriting Kiwi, I just have let
Kiwi do the default partition layout (first partition squashfs, second
ext3) and then I shrinked second partition and move both of them to the
end of the stick. (I used cfdisk, resize2fs and dd to achieve it). I
created FAT partition on the first part of stick.

Then I reinstalled grub with a new menu.lst config and unpacked initrd
created by Kiwi, had a nice time reading it and changed three variables
reffering to root partition of the stick, read only partition and
read-write partition. Repacked initrd, copied it over and it worked.

Good night, maybe I will write something more detailed later.

Original message:
Hello,
I am a newbie to Kiwi build system and it is pretty interesting piece of
software. I tried to build several usb stick live systems and they work
great.

But now I am trying to do much more different setup than just adding
some packages to config.xml. I have read the documentation to kiwi and
haven't found a clue, how to do it, so here is my question:
Is there a simple (or hard :o)) way to build an usb stick (doesn't
matter if it would incorporate ext3, squashfs or split system - but
split system would be prefferable to me), which would have this
partitioning layout?
/dev/sda1 ---&gt; vfat
/dev/sdaX ---&gt; bootable system built by kiwi (two partitions in case of
split system, I think)

It is important to have the fat partition first, because I need to use
the usb stick on Windows machines.

I am currently experimenting with building an oem image and manually
editing the partition layout, /etc/fstab and grub settings, but still
with no luck.

Thanks for an advise,
Lukas Pecha
