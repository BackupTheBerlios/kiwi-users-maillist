<PRE>Hi Julien,

&gt;<i> i have several question on kiwi
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to build a master with SLED SP2 and currently i am using autoyast
</I>&gt;<i> with some scripts of post an pre installation I use autoyast because i have
</I>&gt;<i> different type of hardware on my IT park and I would like to know if kiwi
</I>&gt;<i> can do the same thing or if it will be more convenient
</I>&gt;<i> If i well understand kiwi does a image so if I think good an image will
</I>&gt;<i> match only for a specific hardware ?
</I>
images created with kiwi can be used on any hardware which
corresponds with the OS image architecture. BUT the initial
deployment phase of the kiwi bootsystem (initrd) does a hardware
detection only for the hardware which is required in order to
bring the system up. This includes the following:

 a) storage device detection, harddisks, USB sticks, etc...
 b) boot device detection, CD, DVD, fixed disk
 b) network device detection

When booting into the system the creator of the kiwi image description
this is you :-) decides for further hardware detection and configuration
steps. At that point many people combine the yast functionality with
kiwi and run autoyast with a pre-created xml definition. kiwi supports
you integrating the yast XML definition in a way that it is started
automatically on first boot. For details you can read the kiwi.pdf
from the kiwi-doc packages, search for config-yast-firstboot.xml

All in all you can influence the level of automatism yourself by
providing init scripts which does the magic. A very common approach
is the automatic X11 configuration which can be done by calling
sax2 -a. If you are interested in that just have a look at the
/usr/share/doc/kiwi/examples/suse-11.1/suse-live-stick/root/etc/init.d/
directory (package kiwi-doc)

kiwi is in the first place an image creation tool which imho has
advantages when deploying many machines compared to more or less
the same installation procedure with all the rpm calls in it. kiwi
does not take over the process of a global (for all pieces of the system)
hardware detection/configuration. But the OS itself provides enough
tools which you can integrate into your image description relatively
easy to achieve that goal

There is the project called SUSE Studio which is based on kiwi and
also adds some pre-configuration tasks, like X setup, windowmanager setup
and more. Within the project we always try to implement such kind of
configuration in a hardware independent way. If you want to have a look
at it just check this out: <A HREF="http://www.susestudio.com.">http://www.susestudio.com.</A> If you are interested
in this project tell me and I sent you an invitation. This is currently
in an alpha phase

Hope that helps

Regards,
Marcus
