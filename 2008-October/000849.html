<PRE>Hi Marcus,

&gt;&gt;<i> Background: I see a Netbook Medion Akoya Mini E1210 with 160 GB
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at Aldi Nord ;-) and maybe I buy it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *lol* maybe you also think twice :)
</I>
It's official now. I have buy the Akoya Mini E1210. ;-)

**** Begin: OFF TOPIC ****
But I don't like the preinstalled system (here: Windows XP Home).
The guys from medion installed many 3rd-party software.
Some software installed in the system tray or in the memory.
I count 9 symbols. :-( It isn't a good idea for only 1 GB memory.

Software are installed:
- PowerDVD ( *lol* the netbook hasn't a dvd driver.)
- WordPerfect Office X3 (Hm, i prefer OpenOffice)
- Bullgard Internet Security (Hm, it's unnecessary for me)
- Wieso Mein Geld (My Money) (It's unnecessary for me, too)
- Corel Draw Essential 3 (I prefer Gimp)
- Corel Media One (It's for people, who like self-generated photos and
  videos. But not for me.)
- Berlitz (Dictionary) (I prefer Leo.org. The people forget it, because
  it's a netbook and not a notebook. *lol*)
- Symantec System Recovery (I prefer console with the command dd) :-)

It's in fact: The windows system is all-too bloated for this netbook.
**** End: OFF TOPIC ****

&gt;<i> At the moment the inst-source support in kiwi is used only internally.
</I>&gt;<i> I think, and Jan correct me if I'm wrong, it can't be used outside
</I>&gt;<i> the Novell/SUSE infrastructure at the moment. Of course this is planned
</I>&gt;<i> to be possible in the future
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the following article could help you
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="http://en.opensuse.org/Installation_without_CD">http://en.opensuse.org/Installation_without_CD</A>
</I>
Many thanks for this usefully manual.
This is the first step to install openSUSE 11.0 on this netbook.

The installation goes over LAN because the WLAN-Module isn't
supported of the kernel yet and I miss a configuration tool for
WLAN while the installation of openSUSE. Can this tool integrated on
the NET-Install-CD? This is a good idea for further opensuse versions
to install opensuse over WLAN.

After the installation, I compiled the WLAN Kernel-Module from the
source. I'm very glad, that the driver supported directly WPA1 and WPA2.
It's running without any problems. This is great.

The Akoya Mini E1210 runs with openSUSE 11.0 now and I don't give
this netbook away. *gg* This is the one of netbooks that you can
use reasonably ten-finger-system. All others have undersized keys.

Regards,
Sebastian
