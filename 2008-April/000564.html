<PRE>&gt;<i>  I believe we already wrote about many of these things but the doc is hidden
</I>&gt;<i>  too well :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  For me it would be interesting to know what parts of the doc you read and why;
</I>&gt;<i>  how did you find the things you found and why didn't you find the rest?
</I>&gt;<i>  Knowing this we can make the documentation even better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
My main sources are the kiwi.pdf file, the results of kiwi --help, the
examples and KIWIScheme.rnc. Some useful info only appears in the
Changelogs courtesy of google.

Regarding information organization, if I am making a livecd it is
rather natural that I skip the usb or the netboot sections, I think.
Everyone's time is limited and we want to cut to the chase.

The main problem of kiwi's docs is that it is not clear what kiwi
_does_, so it is difficult to figure out what all the parameters are
for and how they affect the final result. This is why I think a
procedural approach (describe kiwi procedure step by step and how
every configuration option affects them) would be a more informative
approach and put everything in its place. Who knows, it might even
help the development team to find opportunities of improvement.

A few things that I have not seen well described anywhere, there are
probably more:
- &lt;packages type=???&gt;
- baseroot
- prebuilt
- role of &lt;root&gt;/image/config.xml in fine tuning.
- role of MD5 sums.
- real life workflow: how to prepare and then fine tune a good
config.xml, description of some important packages, optimization of
the turnaround time (I know this is very specific for every
application, but when you use kiwi a bit some patterns emerge
quickly.)
- optimization of the result: disk space, available RAM, etc.
- mandatory vs optional config.xml elements.

&gt;<i>  You can put your flesh in there; it doesn't have to be perfect DocBook ;) and
</I>&gt;<i>  send us a patch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I am more with Richard in that a wiki would be easier and more
effective in terms of user/developer feedback.
