<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree so in principal it always works like this:
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>
OK, now we have a worthy skeleton :-)

I think this could be the basis of a better user manual. For instance,
it would useful to know when kiwi is acting chrooted, what options
affect each phase, further elaboration on point b) of the CREATE phase
for every type of image, which kiwi built-in functions are available
for the user scripts...

Let's flesh it out a bit:

1. PREPARE

1.1 Building of a new root tree or, in kiwi-speak, a new physical extend.

The building of a new root tree consists of the creation of the
directory specified to hold it and the installation of the selected
packages on it.

1.1.1 Directory creation.

To prevent accidental deletion of an existing root tree, kiwi will
stop with an error message if this folder already exists, unless the
option --force-new-root is used in which case the existing root will
be deleted.

1.1.2 Package installation.

First the selected package manager (smart by default) is instructed to
use the repositories specified in the image definition file.

Then the packages specified in the 'bootstrap' section are installed.
These packages are installed externally to the target root system
(i.e. not chroot'ed) and establish the initial environment so the rest
of  the process may run chroot'ed. Essential packages in this section
are xxx, yyy and zzz. In practice you only need to specify xxx here,
since the rest of the packages will be pulled because of the
dependency system. To save space in your image you could schedule the
packages yyy and zzz for deletion after the phase ppp is over by
listing them in the 'delete' section.

...

(other &lt;packages&gt; sections explained)
...

1.1.2 Optimizations I: using a baseroot tree.

In case you want to make an image based on a previously existing one
(i.e., the old image's package selection is a subset of the new one's
and the changes made by the customization scripts are compatible) you
can save a lot of time in the creation of a new root tree by using the
old one as a base for the new one.

There are three ways of specifying a what we term 'baseroot' tree:

- Using the 'baseroot=&quot;&quot;' attribute of the &lt;type&gt; element.
- Using the optional &lt;defaultbaseroot&gt; element.
- Using the command-line option --base-root.

Provided you have an existing root tree which is based on the same
there are three ways of incorporating the old tree as a basis for the
new one, selectable with the --base-root-mode option:

- --base-root-mode copy. This mode will make a full copy of the old
tree. Copying a tree is faster than reinstalling the old packages.
After that the new packages that weren't selected in the old image
will be installed.
- --base-root-mode recycle. This mode will make the modifications
directly into the old tree (question: are the --root option or the
&lt;defaultroot&gt; element then disregarded if they are specified?) This
means that you cannot use the old root tree for your old image anymore
(unless you backup it, but what its the advantage then?), but it is
faster since it doesn't have even to duplicate it.
- --base-root-mode union. This mode takes advantage of overlay
filesystems (elaborate) so in fact what you create is an incremental
filesystem which holds only the changes to the base one. You must make
sure the old root tree is still available and unmodified when you
perform the 'create' phase for the new one.


1.1.3 Optimization II: using a package cache.

....

1.2 Copy user files.

...

1.3 ...

1.x Tips and tricks

You could use config.sh to save space in your image by:
- deleting packages' documentation (/usr/share/doc)
- deleting locales you won't plan on using.
...

You could have a set of basic images and build on them using the
methods mentioned at 1.1.2. For instance you could have a barebones
image with the minimal packages to boot and allow an user to login.
Based on that, you could create a minimal X window system. Those two
could be the base for more specific applications.

...

2. ROOT TREE TWEAKING.

At this point you can make changes on your physical extend so it fits
your purpose better. Bear in mind that changes at this point will be
discarded and not repeated automatically if you rerun the 'prepare'
phase unless you include them in your original config.xml and
config.sh script.

2.1 Adding new packages.

2.2 Upgrading packages.

...

3. CREATE

3.1 User script image.sh
...

3.2 Image type specific operations.

3.2.1 ISOboot

3.2.2 USBboot

3.2.3 ...

What's this sound like?
