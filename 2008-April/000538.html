<PRE>Hi, I have been playing around with Kiwi with variable amount of success.

One of the things I find more uncomfortable is that the tool is very
monolithic, so every time you make a small change, a lot of operations
are unnecessarily repeated. Normally you do not come up with the
perfect config.xml from scratch, you have to fine tune your image one
step at a time (add a package here, tweak a rc file there...) and then
you have to redownload the packages and build all the mammoth again.
Not fun :(

Being no expert in the intricacies or either Suse and smart I found a
little trick to avoid repeated downloads: redirect kiwi log to the
terminal (--logfile terminal) and after all the new packages are
downloaded pause the process (Ctrl-Z), copy the contents of
yourkiwiroot/var/lib/smart/packages in a directory and add that
directory to the config file as a rpm-dir repo. I'm sure you could
come up with cleverer schemes, but my research time in tools I am not
familiar with is unfortunately limited and this pedestrian hack just
works. It shouldn't be too difficult to mainstream something like this
and add a --rpmcachedir option, should it?

Now I am intrigued by a the nifty 'baseroot' option that promises to
&quot;speed up the build process.&quot; An example on how would this work would
be heartily welcome, please. Couldn't find anything in the docs, the
sample images or either mailing list.

Sometimes I have chroot'ed the prepared root system, tweaked things
there and then exported the changes to the image dir, so if I have to
re-prepare they are performed again. But I am always having the
nagging suspicion that I might break something. It would be nice if
the devels could state what can and what cannot be done in a chroot'ed
prepared environment so:
a) It doesn't interfere with the --create process.
b) It is automatically repeated if the --prepare process must be retriggered.

So long, and thanks for all the fruit :)
