<PRE>Hi Luis,

&gt;<i> OK, now we have a worthy skeleton :-)
</I>
:<i>-) yep
</I>
&gt;<i> I think this could be the basis of a better user manual. For instance,
</I>&gt;<i> it would useful to know when kiwi is acting chrooted, what options
</I>&gt;<i> affect each phase, further elaboration on point b) of the CREATE phase
</I>&gt;<i> for every type of image, which kiwi built-in functions are available
</I>&gt;<i> for the user scripts...
</I>
I agree we can improve a lot in that area and some of the information
provided today are outdated or obsolete. I really appreciate your help.
But we should first agree on a place where to put the stuff into.
The information we discuss here should imho go to the design document
because of two reasons:

1) it explains how it works in a more or less rough overview which
   serves as a good starting point for more details. I like this
   approach

2) not all users are really interested in how it works they just want
   to use the result. So I think it would be too much information for
   the quickstart because there we are directly referencing working
   examples

* So first question do we agree to have this information as part
  of the design/system documentation ? ( this is the kiwi.pdf file)

* If we agree I would say let's make a draft as simple text and
  let me pass the result to my colleagues from the docu team. All
  the documentation which exists for kiwi is already in a format
  which allows the docu team to work on it with respect to their
  development rules. So this is primarly a question for Thomas:
  Thomas would that be ok for you ?

&gt;<i> Let's flesh it out a bit:
</I>
right, ok...

&gt;<i> 1. PREPARE
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.1 Building of a new root tree or, in kiwi-speak, a new physical extend.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The building of a new root tree consists of the creation of the
</I>&gt;<i> directory specified to hold it and the installation of the selected
</I>&gt;<i> packages on it.
</I>
fine

&gt;<i> 1.1.1 Directory creation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To prevent accidental deletion of an existing root tree, kiwi will
</I>&gt;<i> stop with an error message if this folder already exists, unless the
</I>&gt;<i> option --force-new-root is used in which case the existing root will
</I>&gt;<i> be deleted.
</I>
fine

&gt;<i> 1.1.2 Package installation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First the selected package manager (smart by default) is instructed to
</I>&gt;<i> use the repositories specified in the image definition file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then the packages specified in the 'bootstrap' section are installed.
</I>&gt;<i> These packages are installed externally to the target root system
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. not chroot'ed) and establish the initial environment so the rest
</I>&gt;<i> of  the process may run chroot'ed. Essential packages in this section
</I>&gt;<i> are xxx, yyy and zzz. In practice you only need to specify xxx here,
</I>&gt;<i> since the rest of the packages will be pulled because of the
</I>&gt;<i> dependency system. To save space in your image you could schedule the
</I>&gt;<i> packages yyy and zzz for deletion after the phase ppp is over by
</I>&gt;<i> listing them in the 'delete' section.
</I>
great 

&gt;<i> (other &lt;packages&gt; sections explained)
</I>
maybe yes but the mandatory ones are already mentioned


I would like the following to be a seperate chapter.
What do you think ? I think people start to optimize after
they had the feeling of success and that's something they
will have after the create step 

=======snip========

&gt;<i> 1.1.2 Optimizations I: using a baseroot tree.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In case you want to make an image based on a previously existing one
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e., the old image's package selection is a subset of the new one's
</I>&gt;<i> and the changes made by the customization scripts are compatible) you
</I>&gt;<i> can save a lot of time in the creation of a new root tree by using the
</I>&gt;<i> old one as a base for the new one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are three ways of specifying a what we term 'baseroot' tree:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Using the 'baseroot=&quot;&quot;' attribute of the &lt;type&gt; element.
</I>&gt;<i> - Using the optional &lt;defaultbaseroot&gt; element.
</I>&gt;<i> - Using the command-line option --base-root.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Provided you have an existing root tree which is based on the same
</I>&gt;<i> there are three ways of incorporating the old tree as a basis for the
</I>&gt;<i> new one, selectable with the --base-root-mode option:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - --base-root-mode copy. This mode will make a full copy of the old
</I>&gt;<i> tree. Copying a tree is faster than reinstalling the old packages.
</I>&gt;<i> After that the new packages that weren't selected in the old image
</I>&gt;<i> will be installed.
</I>&gt;<i> - --base-root-mode recycle. This mode will make the modifications
</I>&gt;<i> directly into the old tree (question: are the --root option or the
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;defaultroot&gt; element then disregarded if they are specified?) This
</I>&gt;<i> means that you cannot use the old root tree for your old image anymore
</I>&gt;<i> (unless you backup it, but what its the advantage then?), but it is
</I>&gt;<i> faster since it doesn't have even to duplicate it.
</I>&gt;<i> - --base-root-mode union. This mode takes advantage of overlay
</I>&gt;<i> filesystems (elaborate) so in fact what you create is an incremental
</I>&gt;<i> filesystem which holds only the changes to the base one. You must make
</I>&gt;<i> sure the old root tree is still available and unmodified when you
</I>&gt;<i> perform the 'create' phase for the new one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.1.3 Optimization II: using a package cache.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ....
</I> 
========snap==========


&gt;<i> 1.2 Copy user files.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
fine


I think the tips and tricks should also be a seperate chapter
but we should mention that config.sh is called
=========snip==========
&gt;<i> 1.3 ...
</I>&gt;<i> 1.x Tips and tricks
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You could use config.sh to save space in your image by:
</I>&gt;<i> - deleting packages' documentation (/usr/share/doc)
</I>&gt;<i> - deleting locales you won't plan on using.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You could have a set of basic images and build on them using the
</I>&gt;<i> methods mentioned at 1.1.2. For instance you could have a barebones
</I>&gt;<i> image with the minimal packages to boot and allow an user to login.
</I>&gt;<i> Based on that, you could create a minimal X window system. Those two
</I>&gt;<i> could be the base for more specific applications.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>=========snap============


I'm not sure if I like the following. As a standard user I would
think what does &quot;root tree tweaking&quot; mean :) maybe we change that
to something like &quot;Managing the prepared image tree&quot; and list what
one can do with the tree before calling --create. The new --testsuite
option can also explained here. I also think this could be a seperate
chapter
===========snip============= 
&gt;<i> 2. ROOT TREE TWEAKING.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At this point you can make changes on your physical extend so it fits
</I>&gt;<i> your purpose better. Bear in mind that changes at this point will be
</I>&gt;<i> discarded and not repeated automatically if you rerun the 'prepare'
</I>&gt;<i> phase unless you include them in your original config.xml and
</I>&gt;<i> config.sh script.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2.1 Adding new packages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2.2 Upgrading packages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>==========snap===============


&gt;<i> 3. CREATE
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3.1 User script image.sh
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
fine

&gt;<i> 3.2 Image type specific operations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3.2.1 ISOboot
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3.2.2 USBboot
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3.2.3 ...
</I>
I think here we should explain in short which types are used
for what purpose and maybe point to a more detailed description
each type could be a single chapter

&gt;<i> What's this sound like?
</I>
It sounds great. I would like to have that structure in the
kiwi.pdf directly after the introduction and the basic concept 
Thomas what do you think ?

Can we make a draft of that and safe it somewhere ? I can offer
the kiwi svn as temporary place. If you Luis, Jan and Thomas
have a good mind to help me with this we also could define
who starts to document what. I think we could identify the
following parts:

a) general workflow
b) the tips and tricks chapter
c) the optimization chapter
d) the type explanations and chapters
e) the managing prepared tree chapter

I could do d) and e) :-)

Regards,
Marcus
