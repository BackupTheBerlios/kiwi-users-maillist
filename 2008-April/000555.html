<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i>  &gt; Now I have a /var/lib/smart/packages in chroot but it is emptied after
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; the installation, I have checked interrupting the process during the
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; installation phase.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  this has been fixed now according to your investigations. Thanks
</I>
OK, I see that your patch simply adds this option to smart. Perhaps to
keep backwards compatibility you could leave the default behavior as
it is now and add a --keep-package-cache option or something.
Otherwise some cleaning must be done before packing the image, 'smart
clean' . Or perhaps there is a way to prevent the contents of that
folder to make it to the image?

Anyway, I wanted to test it, so I added a package to the 'image'
section of myroot/image/config.xml and run kiwi -u myroot, but the new
package was not installed. Was that not the correct method?

I have also tried to use the checkprebuilt option as you suggested,
that is indeed useful, thanks.


&gt;<i>  imho the smart cache does not only contain packages it also has the
</I>&gt;<i>  latest dependency resolution and other data in it which may be
</I>&gt;<i>  obsolete in another new situation. The code in smart to find that
</I>&gt;<i>  the cache needs to be rebuilt may consume more time compared to
</I>&gt;<i>  build up a new cache. That's one thing and the other problem I see
</I>
Well, you could use then createrepo to create a local rpm-md
repository. I tested it and works fine, smart doesn't have to compute
anything then. However there is the problem of having it updated
manually. What would be cool, especially for local networks, would be
a sort of proxy cache repo system so you don't have to mirror every
single package, but only those which are pulled from the master repo,
but I haven't seen anything like that anywhere. Perhaps you could do
that with squid...

&gt;<i>  is that your packages cache could be from distribution let's say
</I>&gt;<i>  10.3 but your next image is for 11.0 so the package cache is
</I>&gt;<i>  only a huge data which you can't use for this image. That's why
</I>&gt;<i>  I said you need some magic to find out whether the use of the
</I>&gt;<i>  cache really improves the action
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hmm, well, that would mean changing repos in the config, so instead of
changing it to point to your remote 10.3 repo you use your local 11.0
repo. Kiwi cannot guess what version are you targeting, right?

Say, is there some kind of document with a list of the operations
performed by kiwi and in what order are they executed? That would be
very useful to figure out what's happening when. Like:

&quot;config.sh is an optional configuration script used during the
creation of the physical extend. This script is executed at the end of
the installation after the chroot command is used to switch to the
operating system image but before the package scripts paced in the
config directory (see the section called &quot; config &quot;) are run. This
script can be used, for example, to configure the image system by
activating or deactivating services.&quot;

but for the whole kiwi process.

Luis
