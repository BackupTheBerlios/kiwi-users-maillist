<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> One of the things I find more uncomfortable is that the tool is very
</I>&gt;<i> monolithic, so every time you make a small change, a lot of operations
</I>&gt;<i> are unnecessarily repeated. Normally you do not come up with the
</I>&gt;<i> perfect config.xml from scratch, you have to fine tune your image one
</I>&gt;<i> step at a time (add a package here, tweak a rc file there...) and then
</I>&gt;<i> you have to redownload the packages and build all the mammoth again.
</I>&gt;<i> Not fun :(
</I>
There are ways to make that more comfortable. In principal the
following &quot;optimizations&quot; are already in place:

1) you can use a pre-built boot image which means the initrd
   can be previously built and you can re-use it with any
   subsequent --create step. To make use of this take a look
   at the following example:

   kiwi -p /usr/share/kiwi/image/netboot/suse-10.3 \
        --root /tmp/myboot

   kiwi --create /tmp/myboot \
        -d /usr/share/kiwi/image/netboot/suse-10.3-prebuilt

   ==&gt; the destination directory name must be the prepare path
       followed by the prefix -prebuilt

   add in your system image config.xml to the image type which should
   use the prebuilt boot image the following attribute:

   &lt;type .... checkprebuilt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;...&lt;/type&gt;

2) if you store the prepared tree you are free to change it in
   terms of config files or something. You also have the possibility
   to add packages in the config.xml description _inside_ the
   tree:

     path-to-tree/image/config.xml

   and after that you can run

     kiwi --upgrade

   you also can use the upgrade if only the source repo has changed.
   For example update of a package.

   In any of these cases you are only upgrading an existing tree
   which is faster than rebuilding it

3) if you don't want to re-prepare a complete root tree but you
   know it's based on the same set of packages you also can create
   a base root system first and use this tree as the base for your
   images. the prepare step is much faster depending on the
   differences. So you can for example create a base root tree
   as part of a &quot;generic&quot; image description (base 10.3 for example)
   after that you can create your own special 10.3 image description
   which is a simply copy of the base image description but changed
   by you. After that you can call kiwi like you would do to build
   a normal image but you can specify with the --base-root option
   the path to the already prepared base root data. In the
   base-root mode &quot;copy&quot; kiwi will copy the base tree and modify
   this tree. The copy is faster than rebuilding the base-root by
   an &quot;installation&quot; process. The fastest way to use a base-root
   is to make use of an overlay filesystem. Your new root system
   will consist of only the differences according to the base-root
   tree in this mode. This also means the base-root is required for
   prepare _and_ create which is different from the copy mode. In
   the recyle mode the base-root will be modified directly which
   means you can use the original base-root only once if you don't
   have a backup copy
    
The default behavior of kiwi is &quot;slow but safe&quot;. As you know it
builds complete operating systems and applications it's urgently
required to take an eye on the integrity of the system which I can
only make sure exists if we start building the image from an
empty root tree.

&gt;<i> Being no expert in the intricacies or either Suse and smart I found a
</I>&gt;<i> little trick to avoid repeated downloads: redirect kiwi log to the
</I>&gt;<i> terminal (--logfile terminal) and after all the new packages are
</I>&gt;<i> downloaded pause the process (Ctrl-Z), copy the contents of
</I>&gt;<i> yourkiwiroot/var/lib/smart/packages in a directory and add that
</I>&gt;<i> directory to the config file as a rpm-dir repo. I'm sure you could
</I>&gt;<i> come up with cleverer schemes, but my research time in tools I am not
</I>&gt;<i> familiar with is unfortunately limited and this pedestrian hack just
</I>&gt;<i> works. It shouldn't be too difficult to mainstream something like this
</I>&gt;<i> and add a --rpmcachedir option, should it?
</I>
The current version of kiwi does this. See KIWIManager:85

	my $dataDir = &quot;$root/var/lib/smart&quot;;

&gt;<i> Now I am intrigued by a the nifty 'baseroot' option that promises to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;speed up the build process.&quot; An example on how would this work would
</I>&gt;<i> be heartily welcome, please. Couldn't find anything in the docs, the
</I>&gt;<i> sample images or either mailing list.
</I>
You can give it a try with your current image description. Just
prepare a tree and name it your base root:

	kiwi -p &lt;your-image-description&gt; --root /tmp/myBaseRoot

now copy your image description and add changes into the copy
for example add a package into the description. After that call

	kiwi -p &lt;your-image-description-copy&gt; --root /tmp/myimage \
		--base-root /tmp/myBaseRoot

As I explained there are different base-root modes which you can
give a try with:

	--base-root-mode &lt;copy|union|recycle&gt;

&gt;<i> Sometimes I have chroot'ed the prepared root system, tweaked things
</I>&gt;<i> there and then exported the changes to the image dir, so if I have to
</I>&gt;<i> re-prepare they are performed again. But I am always having the
</I>&gt;<i> nagging suspicion that I might break something. It would be nice if
</I>&gt;<i> the devels could state what can and what cannot be done in a chroot'ed
</I>&gt;<i> prepared environment so:
</I>&gt;<i> a) It doesn't interfere with the --create process.
</I>&gt;<i> b) It is automatically repeated if the --prepare process must be retriggered.
</I>
There will be a KIWITest module in the future which allows you to
check the integrity after such changes.

I think what I can't do is

a) automatically repeat manual user changes which had happen as consequence
   of a chroot ... vi ... action. The one who does this has enough knowledge
   to persistently store the manual changes as command sequence in a
   config.sh or images.sh script and save that as part of the image description
   which persistently stores the changes and re-apply them if required

b) as you are free to do anything with the prepared tree for example
   remove /bin or other important data it's hard to make sure that
   manual changes doesn't interfere with the later --create process

Marcus
