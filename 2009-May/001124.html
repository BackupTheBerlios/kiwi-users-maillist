A bit more info. I see that the driver IS in my initrd image, but it is
not present in the running system. So I am guessing that it is hidden
when the root file system is mounted. This is what fooled me at first.

However, if the driver is in the initrd image, I am guessing it would be
loaded at boot, and stay there. If the root mount later hides this in
the file system, it does not matter, right?

So, maybe I don't need to do anything? I won't really know until next
week when the user actually turns the device on. I am just preparing
myself.

Is this more evidence of intelligent design in KIWI? :)
