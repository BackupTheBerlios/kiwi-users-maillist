<PRE>Vladimir,

&gt;<i> I see.
</I>&gt;<i> Flexibility and stability are antonyms,
</I>&gt;<i> at least in common sense ;)
</I>
That's correct the more you can do the more mistakes you can
make. But the design of kiwi was not to prevent somebody to
score an own goal :)

Before I started the implementation I saw many different codings
which were all located in the same area but they were all done for
one or two specific requirement purposes and not compatible to each
other. The result was not re-usable or maintainable code which also
most often worked on one specific version of an OS only.

If you ask 100 people for their needs in the Imaging area you
get 80 different requirements. With kiwi I'd like to be able to
offer one tool to make them all happy but that also means service
and help from the operating system vendor. Novell is really
focused in the appliance market and that means a strong
communication and partnership with application vendors to
integrate their software smootly into the OS. In my opinion
you can't separate tools and service in the Image world to be
successful

The idea of kiwi is also to be able to re-use what others did.
Everything inside an image description can serve as a template
for somebody else with the same or a similar problem. Adapting
an existing solution seems to be easier than starting from
scratch

stability and security are important for kiwi but as of the
design they can only be guaranteed to some degree. I fully agree
to what you have said here. In other words we don't prevent somebody
from removing potentionally important files of the image in for
example config.sh. So for me it's important that when kiwi runs
it works reliable and the result should be as stable and secure
as the creator of the image description took care of. If that
applies an image description can be signed and also certified
which then guarantees stability, security and supportability
of the system created out of this description. kiwi itself should
not be the code which introduces security or stability
problems... which is a challenge :)

&gt;<i> My focus was sort of opposite, paranoid:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;what could we do to disable any possible tampering
</I>&gt;<i> of image content on the system run?&quot;
</I>
yeah and you are not the only one thinking that way. I really
would like to make that possible if we need to enhance kiwi
to do it let's do it

&gt;<i> Obvious first reaction is: read-only root file system.
</I>&gt;<i> I knew that unionfs encourages altering of
</I>&gt;<i> system files by it's design: top layer is always read-write.
</I>&gt;<i> Even if aufs allows read-only layer on the top of union,
</I>&gt;<i> this option is not used in kiwi.
</I>
That's correct we use the overlay filesystems to allow read-write
for the entire filesystem exactly for the reason one portion is a
read-only filesystem. It would be no big deal to have a config.xml
flag which says &quot;mount this union but mount it read-only&quot;. The
problem with this would be that the system doesn't work well if you
really can't write to nowhere. Each login attempt for example is
logged by pam and if it can't write that information the login failed.
So as consequence you would have a system you can't login to

&gt;<i> Therefore only split image type left then
</I>&gt;<i> as the candidate for read-only root.
</I>
correct

&gt;<i> In this case, it may worth to not mess up
</I>&gt;<i> with two opposite requirements, but rather
</I>&gt;<i>  * invent new type of image, or
</I>&gt;<i>  * adjust one of other type images to
</I>&gt;<i> include option of read-only root, or something similar,
</I>&gt;<i> such as option &quot;immune&quot;.
</I>
I would vote for the second option even though I'm not sure if
a 100% not writable root system will work for you

&gt;<i> I end up my image build with similar conclusion.
</I>&gt;<i> There are little changes made in linuxrc
</I>&gt;<i> I could send you for certainty in further discussion,
</I>&gt;<i> out of kiwi-users list, if you don't mind.
</I>
That would be great I appreciate all your help and patches

Thanks

Regards,
Marcus
