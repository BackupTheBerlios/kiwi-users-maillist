<PRE>Markus, --

&gt;<i> The motivation is to have a full flexible system.
</I>
I see.
Flexibility and stability are antonyms,
at least in common sense ;)

&gt;<i> We had that system before and it turned out to be not
</I>&gt;<i> flexible enough.
</I>
Such kind of reason I've suspected,
all right.
While stability and security were not on the table,
design decision made seems adequate.

My focus was sort of opposite, paranoid:
&quot;what could we do to disable any possible tampering
of image content on the system run?&quot;

Obvious first reaction is: read-only root file system.
I knew that unionfs encourages altering of
system files by it's design: top layer is always read-write.
Even if aufs allows read-only layer on the top of union,
this option is not used in kiwi.
Therefore only split image type left then
as the candidate for read-only root.
Now I see, split image won't fit security needs,
because of different point.
As of 11.4.5 section in kiwi.pdf:
&quot;Unfortunately all common compressed filesystems
provides only read-only access.&quot;

Thanks to your detailed explanations, we can conclude that
read-only part of image had been considered as
a media restriction, rather then opportunity
for improve system security.

In this case, it may worth to not mess up
with two opposite requirements, but rather
 * invent new type of image, or
 * adjust one of other type images to
include option of read-only root, or something similar,
such as option &quot;immune&quot;.

&gt;<i> I think that we have both a full flexible system but also at
</I>&gt;<i> least a standard system working of no split information is there.
</I>
Agreed,
I end up my image build with similar conclusion.
There are little changes made in linuxrc
I could send you for certainty in further discussion,
out of kiwi-users list, if you don't mind.

Thanks!
