I will surely use the info on this page. Thanks. But it doesn't REALLY
answer the question. When taking a package from Factory, one gets what
one gets that day. I thought the purpose of the release directories was
to choose a stable one and package that. I am guessing it was an
oversight to package a stable one for 11.1. Why isn't AoE in 11.1?

Re: The comment in the page that says AoE makes SATA disks available: Is
it so specific? A SCSI disk wouldn't work?

I will try to add my boot times to this page. This brings up an
interesting question: I use nbd at this time. A while back, I found that
booting with a faster network (a 1 gbit switch instead of a 100 mbit one
could make the difference) could very often fail when the nbd image is
first set up. I have taken contact with the nbd author and he has made a
patch that seems to correct this issue. (He has been too busy to get the
patch in his release, but promises to do so soon.) OTOH, I see in the
current KIWI a thing I had not seen before: during boot, and just before
mounting the nbd volume, there is a delay with a statement about waiting
for the nbd server or client to settle down. This is just before the
point of failure I had been experiencing. Was this added to address the
problem I was describing? Or was this always there and I missed it? I
can't think so as I looked at the older messages so many times when
originally trying to sort out the issue.
