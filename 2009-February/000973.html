<PRE>Hi Roger,

&gt;<i> Last time I made new KIWI-based images was for openSUSE 10.3. I have
</I>&gt;<i> decided to try my hand at making images for openSUSE 11.1 using the
</I>&gt;<i> latest kiwi in the repository for that release. Just so I do not get too
</I>&gt;<i> far behind!
</I>
I'm sorry that you got stuck but I'm sure we'll bring you
back on the green line :)

&gt;<i> I decided to start with
</I>&gt;<i> the /usr/share/kiwi/image/netboot/suse-11.1/config.xml script,
</I>
It's better to install the kiwi-doc package and start with the
examples provided per distro here:

   /usr/share/doc/packages/kiwi/examples

&gt;<i> and then make changes as I see fit based on my previous 10.3 script.
</I>&gt;<i> The first change was that I wanted pxe images, so I changed
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	&lt;type bootprofile=&quot;default&quot;&gt;cpio&lt;/type&gt;
</I>
Please do not change the boot image descriptions as they are
provided by kiwi itself. The boot image descriptions are used to
create the initrd which is loaded by the kernel and containing
the code to boot your machine according to the desired image type.
If you change data there the checksum build at build time of the
kiwi-desc-* package will no longer match and you can't create
images anymore.

* So first I'd like to ask you to revert your changes made in the
  /usr/share/kiwi/image/netboot/suse-11.1/ directory. Easiest way is
  to re-install the kiwi-desc-netboot package

* after that install the kiwi-doc package and take a look to the
  following example:

     /usr/share/doc/packages/kiwi/examples/suse-11.1/suse-pxe-client

  If you like you can copy that directory or do your changes
  directly in here

&gt;<i> 	&lt;type filesystem=&quot;squashfs&quot; boot=&quot;netboot/suse-11.1&quot;&gt;pxe&lt;/type&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> which seems sort of the right thing to do. What I am unsure about is the
</I>&gt;<i> bootprofile= and boot= options. I think I want to use the diskless
</I>&gt;<i> profile defined in the config.xml file. How do I specify that I want to
</I>&gt;<i> use that profile?
</I>
To use the diskless profile your type setup should look like this:

   &lt;type 
     filesystem=&quot;squashfs&quot;
     boot=&quot;netboot/suse-11.1&quot;
     bootprofile=&quot;diskless&quot;
   &gt;pxe&lt;/type&gt;

&gt;<i> And, if I specify bootprofile= what is the function of
</I>&gt;<i> the boot= option?
</I>
The boot attribute specifies which boot image (initrd) should be
used to boot your pxe image. The information of &quot;netboot/suse-11.1&quot;
tells kiwi to automatically build a boot image from the description
provided in /usr/share/kiwi/image/netboot/suse-11.1. These boot images
are provided by kiwi itself and mainly contains the instructions
to boot the system. The bootprofile is a customization of the selected
boot image description. it tells kiwi to apply the diskless profile
to the selected netboot/suse-11.1 boot image when kiwi creates it

&gt;<i> But the real show stopper is that kiwi no longer finds my config.sh and
</I>&gt;<i> image.sh scripts. They are in the current directory when I start kiwi.
</I>&gt;<i> That did work before. I get a message that it is looking
</I>&gt;<i> for /tmp/config.sh. I think this is a chroot place. I do not specify
</I>&gt;<i> this anywhere. Where/how is that now specified?
</I>
I guess that's because you added them in the boot image description
and not in your own system image description. As I said do not change
the boot image descriptions you are free to do anything with your
system image description (that's the one in /usr/share/doc/packages/kiwi/examples/suse-11.1/suse-pxe-client or wherever you copied it to) but for the
moment I recommend to leave /usr/share/kiwi/image/*boot untouched

Some words about the image build process. When you call the kiwi create
step after you have successfully called the prepare step kiwi _automatically_
calls itself to create the specified boot image (initrd). That happens
because every operating system needs to boot somehow. On the very first
level the kernel is loaded which is in your case done by the pxe implementation
in the BIOS of your clients. After the kernel has been loaded the initrd
is loaded. The initrd is what we call the boot image in kiwi. The initrd
itself can be seen as kind of a very very small linux system... an image
which is the reason why kiwi doesn't distinguish between a system and a
boot image description from the level of describing them. After the initrd
was loaded the kernel calls the program linuxrc or init and the coding
of this program controlls the boot of the system. The main task of the
initrd is to activate the _real_ system. The real system is what we
call the system image in kiwi. So if you understand that there is a boot
image description which you don't need to touch and a system image
description which is the one you need to create you will be soon an
appliance expert :-)

Hope that helps

Regards,
Marcus
