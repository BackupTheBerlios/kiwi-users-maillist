<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I will surely use the info on this page. Thanks. But it doesn't REALLY
</I>&gt;<i> answer the question. When taking a package from Factory, one gets what
</I>&gt;<i> one gets that day. I thought the purpose of the release directories was
</I>&gt;<i> to choose a stable one and package that. I am guessing it was an
</I>&gt;<i> oversight to package a stable one for 11.1. Why isn't AoE in 11.1?
</I>
AoE root support was a late feature, too late for 11.1 to be part of
the GM distro. But I agree to the problem of the rapid development.
To give people more time to test with a version that doesn't change
each day we provide packages in the openSUSE:Tools repo. And a daily
snapshot on the openSUSE:Tools:Devel repo.

&gt;<i> current KIWI a thing I had not seen before: during boot, and just before
</I>&gt;<i> mounting the nbd volume, there is a delay with a statement about waiting
</I>&gt;<i> for the nbd server or client to settle down. This is just before the
</I>&gt;<i> point of failure I had been experiencing. Was this added to address the
</I>&gt;<i> problem I was describing? Or was this always there and I missed it? I
</I>&gt;<i> can't think so as I looked at the older messages so many times when
</I>&gt;<i> originally trying to sort out the issue.
</I>
kiwi calls waitForBlockDevice() on the given device (normally /dev/nbd0)
It did that from the beginning on because after the nbd module is lodaded
into the kernel it takes some time until udev created the device nodes
and that's why we wait for them to become ready before we call
nbd-client on the device

Regards,
Marcus
